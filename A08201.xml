            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Vrpoſing (right Reuerend &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable) to publiſh this little book, it came into my mind to commend the ſame to your honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For it ſeemed to me, that although all good men of al eſtates are bound in conſcience and loue, to contend earneſtly for the faith, which (as S. Iude ſaith) was once giuen to the Saintes: yet are there ſome more proper reaſons, in regard of your two callings, which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in my iudgement, a more peculiar eye and watch vnto theſe cauſes. For being both of the ſame most Honourable table, of her Maieſties moſt graue wiſe and Chriſtian Counſell, where all are ſet in the ſame charge and ioyned in the ſame care, namely in all prouident and
<pb facs="tcp:13587:3"/>
godly ouerſight, to manage the great affaires, pertaining to Gods worſhip and glorie, and the bleſſed ſafetie of the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie (whom God vouchſafe long to preſerue among vs:) yet the one being a miniſter and Biſhoppe of the goſpell, and ſet ouer many others, for the good and faithfull teaching and practiſing of the chriſtian faith in this land: And the other a profeſſed and chiefe Iudge, for the executing of all lawes and ſtatutes, ordeined for the maintenaunce of true religion, iuſtice, peace and godlines: this being a neceſſarie declaration of our Chriſtian faith and religion, eſtabliſhed by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like magiſtracie, and lawes of this realme, and a faithfull diſplaying of the iniquitie of poperie, being a mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and a verie great oppoſite vnto the ſame: It could not ſo properly reſpect any other, whoſe ofifce and profeſsion did ſo neerely and naturally offer it ſelfe to patronize and protect ſo iuſt a matter of this kind. Therefore I humblie craue your Honours fauour, to accept of this my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and your fatherly countenaunce vppon mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt labours. Which, although I frankly acknowledge, might haue beene more eloquently and exquiſitly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by ſome man of greater giftes: yet I hope, that in ſome meaſure it ſhalll ſatiſfie the expectation of ſuch honeſt and Chriſtian readers, who both can and will iudge according to equitie und truth. For my purpoſe being, (conſidering the ſeaſon) to ſhew the antiquitie and certaine truth of our faith and religion, nowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in <hi>England,</hi> and the newneſſe, vncertaintie and falſhoode of the popiſh ſuperſtition: to this ende that it might bee a ſtay to many which wauer and ſeeme nowe readie to fall away: I endeuoured rather to ioyne plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13587:3"/>
and perſpicuitie with breuitie, then by large ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to ſhew great learning, and by direct arguments to make manifeſt an vndoubted truth to the conſcience of all men, for the gayning of ſome vnto Chriſt, rather then by ſaying what I could to trouble the reader with abundance of matter, or hunt for that which is vayne and fruitleſſe. And this verily I thought moſt neceſsarie, and the rather becauſe diuers men in differing manner haue heretofore handled this argument, both that I might giue occaſion to men to enquire after and to reade ſuch godly writinges: and alſo becauſe the preſent ſeaſon ſeemeth to call for the ſame, when poperie beginneth to ouerſpreade, and after a ſort to ſet vp his briſſels againſt the goſpell, and men of that ſuperſtition are verie much lifted vp: that it might appeare, what a fooliſh, wicked, new broacht and monſtrous hereſie and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie they ſo much contend for &amp; ſo egerly labour for: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greedie of that which will ſlay their ſoules, and proud of that whereof they ought to bee aſhamed. Therefore I haue made choice of ſuch methode and reaſons, as I hope thorow Gods bleſsing, ſhall effect that I purpoſed, and make that manifeſt which I deſire. Whereof knowing that your Honours can iudge with wiſedome, and that your Chriſtian care tendeth to this ende, that the people by all good meanes ſhould bee ſtaide, in their faithfull obedience to God and our moſt gracious prince: I was bolde to preſent this booke vnto you, moſt humblie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you to accepte of my bounden duetie to my Prince, countrie, and to the Church of GOD: ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie praying GOD to bee with you alwayes with his gracious fauour and good ſpirite, to guide you

But the day of her Maieſties moſt royall coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a day of light and glorie, a day of cleare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy: in that day did the ſunne of righteouſnes ariſe &amp; ſhined from on hie, hee caſt forth his bright and pleaſant beames, and enlightened all the land. Then fell away the groſſe miſſe of palpable fooliſhneſſe and ignorance, and the vaile of mans preſumption was taken from our hartes. Then humane deuiſes, and the greeuous yoke of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall bondage in tradition &amp; voluntary ſeruice of men, was taken from our necks. Then were our hearts opened and the light of the knowledge of the glorie of God, and his bright ſhining countenance in the face of Ieſus Chriſt did ſhine into our ſoules. It was a day that the verie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of heauen did reioyce and ſing, becauſe of the ſweet &amp; bleſſed tidings of great ioy vnto al the people of this land.

and hee became our ſtrong ſanctuarie, and viſited vs with his rich mercie and ſaluation: his bleſſings ſpirituall and corporall moſt plentiful, flowed down from heauen vpon our land. So that our enemies being Iudges, it muſt needes be ſaid: God hath done great things for vs, and hath giuen vs all things aboundantly to enioy. In which time many nations round about vs, in greeuous darkneſſe and bloudy miſerie, euen mourning dayly before our eyes, might well haue counted themſelues happie, if they had part of our peace. We haue lent and not borrowed, wee haue giuen and not taken: we haue beene a refuge for the poore, and a place of ſuccour for the perſecuted: our men and money haue beene a reliefe to the oppreſſed and deliueraunce to many in great daunger and diſtreſſe.

O that I could boldly and faithfully ſo ſay; &amp; that our ſiluer were not become droſſe, and our wine mixt with water. And that the vine which God hath planted with good and pleaſant plants, did not in ſtead of grapes bring forth wild grapes: and men did not neglect yea forſake the word of the Lord, and follow the fooliſh imaginations of their owne heartes. O that it might not be iuſtly ſaid, that the Lord hath a controuerſie with this lande, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercie, nor knowledge of God in the land. By ſwearing and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and killing, and ſtealing, and whooring, they breake out, and bloud toucheth bloud. And that men did not encourage one another, in their wicked and vicious liuing, ſaying: come and let vs bring wine, and wee will fill our ſelues with ſtrong drinke, and to morrow ſhall bee as this day, and much more aboundant, let vs eate and drinke for to morrow we ſhall die. O that men would conſider and that their hearts would ſmite them, in remembring and forethinking what a fatherly watch word, our tender and louing God hath giuen vs, by many and ſundry moſt mild and kindly tempered corrections and chaſtiſementes, at many times: but eſpecially within theſe eighteene yeares laſt paſt, when hee beganne at his ſanctuarie, and lightly touched his holy remembrancers, when he cauſed a

great and cloudie miſt to couer the verie heauens, ſo that many bright ſtarres were not ſeene to ſhine for a certaine ſeaſon. Then did the windes burſt out ſhaking our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ouer our heades, as vnworthie to dwell vnder ſo good and plentifull grace: our bodies and liues were aſſailed with grieuous peſtilence, dearth, ſcarſitie, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſword did aduance themſelues againſt vs. Thouſands haue gone forth and returned but by hundreds. And now ſeeing all theſe things haue not made vs to turne to him that ſmiteth, neither do men ſeeke the Lord: behold euerie man ſeeth how his anger is kindled more and more, and how neere his ſword is come vnto vs, that the Lords wrath is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill. But yet if it pleaſe thee O God and mercifull father, bee thou entreated by thy poore ſeruants, (who ſeeing the plague, call night and day vpon thee) that thou take not ſo great vengeance of our ſinnes, as to make the ſweete ſtreaming fountains, which water all thy holy temple and the garden of thy delight among vs, to be ſalt and vnſauourie: or to let that burning ſtarre of wormewood, which is fallen from heauen to touch our riuers of waters: or that thou ſhouldſt make the heart of this people fat, and their eares heauie &amp; ſhut their eyes, leaſt they ſee with their eies, and heare with their eares, and vnderſtand with their heartes and conuert and thou heale them. Why ſhould we be as men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generation, which know not and remember not thy great workes, which thou haſt done, by our princely Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, and the great victorie ouer the Cananites of the land, by thine annointed handmaid our renowned Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah: that our eyes ſhould looke backe to the fleſh pots of Egypt, or that wee ſhould returne to ioyne in friendſhip, with that wicked Babilon, whom thou haſt commanded vs to reward with double, as they haue rewarded vs: and learning their maners, &amp; being partakers of their ſinnes, we ſhould be partakers of their puniſhmentes, and thou ſhouldſt giue vs ouer to the enemie, and they which hate

vs ſhould be Lords ouer vs: and then al theſe good things and the light of thy countenance ſhould bee quite turned from vs, and our glorie forſake vs. We haue indeed ſinned moſt deare father, and our offences are many: yet is there mercie with thee that thou maieſt bee feared: Teach vs therfore thy way O Lord, that we may walk in thy truth: and knit our hearts vnto thee, that we may feare thy holy name, euen for thy holy Son ſake our deare Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt Amen.</p>
            <p>When men waxe rich they begin to bee careleſſe: and by aboundance of peace,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.15.</note> men forget themſelues and fall away: as it is written: <hi>When he waxed fat, he spurned with the heele.</hi> For this cauſe hath God ſet vs miniſters as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſee the plague when it commeth, and to admoniſh the people, that they die not in their ſinnes and to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Take heed, you forget not the Lord your God which hath done all theſe good thinges for you, but feare ye the Lord your God,<note place="margin">The cauſe mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter &amp; purpoſe of this booke.</note> and ſerue him, thou ſhalt cleaue vnto him and ſweare by his name. And this is verily the reaſon of the publiſhing of this treatiſe: wherein I ſhew that the religion and faith publikely profeſſed in this Realme, and maintained by the righteous ſcepter and ſword of our dread ſoueraign and gracious Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, is of the onely truth, moſt auncient, catholicke, and vnchangeable; out of which none euer haue beene ſaued, from the beginning of the world, neither can or ſhall bee. And that the faith and religion, vnder the pretence and name of Chriſt, Peter and Paul, and of the glorious ſhew and title of the Church, which is now profeſſed at Rome, and followed by the vaſſals of the pope, is but a new, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart, hereticall and ſuperſtitious deuiſe of man, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant to the faith of Gods elect, &amp; of the ancient couenant which God gaue &amp; taught Abraham both for Iewes and Gentils, and which Moſes and the prophets declared &amp; expounded, and Chriſt fulfilled and eſtabliſhed, and his
<pb facs="tcp:13587:7"/>
holy Apoſtles publiſhed to all the world, and taught all nations by Chriſtes commandement. For I thought my duetie firſt vnto God, and then to my gracious prince, to ſhew ſome token of my thankefull mind, and ſecondly to acknowledge my bounden duetie to Chriſtes Church here among vs, my deare mother, in whoſe wombe I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe my ſelfe to be bgotten and borne one of Gods children, and though of thouſands the moſt vnworthie yet one of the ſeruants of Chriſt and of his congregation in the miniſterie of his Goſpell. And eſpecially that I might call to remembrance and ſet before the eyes of my louing country men, my louing and faithfull brethren and ſiſters in Chriſt, the aſſuredneſſe of truth and the good treaſure of God among vs: namely that wee are lighted vpon that heauenly pearle (bleſſed be God) for which a man would ſell all that he hath: that this might bee ſome meanes to blow away the aſhes from the cooling zeale of ſome: ſtirre vp and awake ſome that are now readie to ſleepe, and bring backe againe ſome, (if it pleaſe God) which are readie to go out of the way: and that I might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh others that they receiue not the grace of God in vaine. For when a man ſhall thinke with himſelfe (and well way it in his heart) that we haue the true faith which is vnchaungeable, by which all Gods elect are ſaued: will it not moue him to beſtir himſelfe, that he neglect not ſo great ſaluation, and that he trie euerie ſpirit, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and that he be not caried away with the vaine ſhew of oſtentation in men of ſchoole learning: but whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he heare with the men of Berea to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whether thoſe things be ſo? yea though it were Paule or an Angel from heauen ſhould preach another doctrine then that wee haue receiued, we ſhould hold him accurſed. I pray God for Chriſtes ſake to bee mercifull vnto mee, that as he put into mine hart to take this worke in hand, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13587:8"/>
hath graciouſly aſſiſted me and ſtrengthened me to finiſh it, and now to publiſh it. So it would pleaſe him to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his bleſſing to accompanie the ſame, that it may bee accordingly profitable to many, and haue an effectuall fruit to his glorie and the good of his church, in the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and ſtrengthening of weake Chriſtians. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie beg this at his fatherly hands in and by the mediation of his ſon Ieſus Chriſt euen for his holy and bleſſed name, to whom with his holy ſpirit be all praiſe power and dominion for euer.

Wherein is ſhewed, firſt, That wee come to know the true religion, by the true knowledge of God. pag. 1.2. 2. That there is one God, and he is the onely law-giuer. pag. 3. 3. There is but one catholike religion, whereof God is author and maintainer. pag. 3. 4. For this cauſe Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles teach the ſame religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is in the olde teſtament, and the gentils are adopted to bee children vnto Abraham. pag. 5. 5. Here is taken away the obiection which might ariſe by the difference which ſeemeth to be in the three times, before the law, vnder the lawe, and vnder the goſpell. pag. 7. 6. Heere is opened that faith and loue are ſubſtantiall and perpetuall: but by Gods diſpoſition ceremonies and manner of gouernment are changeable. pag. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 7. Although ceremonies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernment are not of the vnchangeable ſubſtance of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet are they to bee reuerently vſed and not violated during the time of Gods aſſignment and preſcription. pag. 14. 15. 16.</item>

In all theſe three times was there a difference in the outward face of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, but not in ſubſtance of religion. pag. 22. 4.

And it will be a witneſſe of our religion now profeſſed in England, againſt all Atheiſts, papiſtes, and other wicked men. pag. 26.</item>

Of the originall of poperie, wherein is declared. 1. That by the precedent Chapters it may appeare to be of a late birth. pag. 205. 206. 2.

               <p n="4">4 For the more plaine euidence of this matter we may obſerue in the new Teſtament two thinges.

Now for the ſecond Chriſt ſaith:<note n="f" place="margin">Matt. 8.12.</note>

                  <hi>This day ſaluation is come into this houſe, for aſmuch as he is alſo become the ſonne of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and it is ſhadowed in that phraſe of Chriſt, where hee ſaith that Lazarus was in Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.<note place="margin">Cap 16.</note> But it is made more plaine by the Apoſtle ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 3.29.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye be Christs then are ye Abrahams ſeede, and heires by promiſe:</hi> So then the goſpel adopteth vs into Abraham to be his children, and the ſame religion, faith, &amp; way of ſaluation, which the new Teſtament teacheth, is the ſumme of the law and prophets and of the fathers before the law, &amp; namely of Abraham, who is the<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> father of vs all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it may bee obiected, that the religion of Gods church did differ and alter; namely that before the law, from that which was after &amp; that of the law, from that which is now vnder the goſpel: For the firſt age had not the law of Moſes; the ſecond were altogether ſubiect to that law: and we after the law, are ruled by the goſpel &amp; are free from that law. For the eaſe of which ſcruple, we are to conſider, that as in material things, there are ſomthings of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; eſſence, which cannot be altered, except the thing it ſelfe periſh, &amp; ſomthings are adioined, &amp; as it were hanging vpon the thing, as moueable properties, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents or ornaments, as in a man the bodie &amp; ſoule vnited are ſo farre off the ſubſtance, that if theſe, or either of theſe faile he is not a man: there be alſo ioined to a man his outward countenance, apparel, ſtature &amp; age, &amp; theſe make a man in outward ſhew,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13587:12"/>
to differ much from himſelfe, yet is he one and the ſame man ſtil: So is it in the caſe of religion there are ſom things of the ſame nature, that if they be abſent, there can be no religion at all; ſuch is faith and loue: ſome thinges are ſeruants and dependances vpon theſe as ceremonies and manner of gouernment; and theſe differ according to the time, and change not the nature of religion. For as a childe is a true naturall man, though hee haue not the ſame ſtature or countenance of face, as when hee is olde and growne vp; and howſoeuer hee change his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, yeeres, ſtature, or countenance, yet is hee the ſame verie man, hee was before. So in religion; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and maner of gouernment, haue altered in their times, and yet make no alteration or change of religion, but doe further garniſhe and beutifie it, more or leſſe according to their ſeaſons; which ſimilitude I vſe becauſe the holie ghoſt hath the like compariſon Gal. 4.1. ſhewing the ſtate of religion vnder the law, to be as a child, that although he be heire yet is vnder tutors &amp;c. So God appointed the fulnes of time vnder the goſpell, when hee woulde beutifie religion which ſuch ornaments, that it ſhold be like the freedome of an heire, when he enioyeth the poſſeſſion of his inheritance, the like wee finde in an other place where he compareth this life vnto the life to come, by theſe wordes,<note n="k" place="margin">1.

of God in reſpect of Christ, that it ſhoulde make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect.</hi> Whereby he ſheweth that the law came not as a new religion, faith, or doctrin of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that the religion before the law ſhould be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, &amp; the law as a new, come in the roome therof; But that it had ſome other vſe, as an accidentarie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament or ſeruant to that former religion which God had taught Abraham ſhold belong vnto all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as after he ſheweth that the law was added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note n="a" place="margin">16. ver. 19.23.24.</note> of tranſgreſſions, &amp; we were ſhut vp vnder the law, and the law was our ſchoolemaſter to bring vs to Chriſt, that we might be made righteous thorow faith, wherby it appeareth that the giuing of the law altered not the religion, faith and doctrin of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but was as an helping ſeruant to further the ſame; as a priſon or ſchoolemaſter to driue vs to the true and pure religion of Abraham, that by faith in the promiſe concerning Chriſt, we are iuſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as Abraham was.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But that you may the better vnderſtand what is now in hand, I will open vnto you what I meane by faith and loue, and what by ceremonies and maner of gouernment. By faith, I vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the doctrin of the couenant of mercy and grace, which is ſo called, becauſe it is apprehended by faith, as in theſe words.<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Receiued ye the ſpirit by the workes of the law, or by the hearing of faith.</hi> In which doctrine wee beleeue the trinitie and vnitie of God, the perſon and office of Chriſt, the creation and fall of man, his corruption, redemption, iuſtification, reſurrection of the dead, eternall life and ſuch like. For all theſe depende one vpon an other, as in the firſt eleuen chapters to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13587:13"/>
Romanes, to the diſcreete and attentiue reader may appeare. By loue I vnderſtand all the duties in the morall law both to God and man, as they are the fruites of faith: and as it is expounded by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſaying:<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 22.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with al thine hart, with all thy ſoule, &amp; with al thy mind: this is the firſt and greateſt commandement, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is like vnto this: thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> By ceremonies and maner of gouernment I vnderſtand all outward rites and ordinances, with the manifeſtation of the ſpirite, which ſerue for the furtherance, beautifying and more fit expreſſing and exerciſe of theſe two aforeſaid. And ceremonies I find to be of two ſorts: ſome which are for the time, maine parts of Gods worſhippe: and ſuch are all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as the ſacrifices and circumciſion before the law, the paſſeouer &amp; al ſacrifices commanded by the law, by ſignes and figures of Chriſt to come, &amp; ſuch are Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper now vnder the goſpel: The other ceremonies concerne the time and place of the Church meeting, and the maner &amp; order in the decent vſage of all the partes of Gods worſhippe, which before the law is ſaid<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 21.33.</note> to bee in groues, and as for other circumſtances there is little mention, as matters of no great moment: vnder the law they<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 4.16.

Now in theſe three times you may ſee, touching theſe ceremonies and maner of gouernment, great difference, and that the word of God doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of theſe outward thinges as of the ſubſtance of religion vnchangeable, as he doth of the inward and ſpirituall, namely faith and loue. And firſt, as touching the time before the law, Chriſt teacheth that the Iewes could not be Abrahams children:<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 8.39.</note> becauſe they did not the works of Abraham: which workes are not in ceremonies and maner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for they were two curious in thoſe things, and therefore Chriſt ſaith in another place:<note n="m" place="margin">Math. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Go and learne what this meaneth, I will haue mercie and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>

Thereby declaring the morall duties of loue, to be ſubſtantiall in a religious profeſſion, &amp; not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as ſacrifice, waſhing, tithinge &amp;c. And S. Paul on the other ſide ſaith thus:<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4.10.11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Abrahams faith was imputed to him for righteouſnes, before hee was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and that after he receiued the ſigne of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the faith which he had when he was vncircumciſed, that he ſhould bee the father of all them that beleeue.</hi> Where hee ſheweth that Abrahams religion whereby hee was iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, was his faith, and that was before hee was circumciſed and without circumciſion: then his circumciſion was onely a ſigne and a ſeale to ſtrengthen his faith, in ſealing vp of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but not of the matter or ſubſtaunce of his righteouſneſſe. Secondly, that this was ſo deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the gentilles which were not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed might bee iuſtified through the ſame faith without the obſeruing of the lawe, and the Iewes though circumciſed, were not iuſtified except they walked in the ſteppes of Abrahams faith: So that herein conſiſteth Abrahams religion, euen in his faith and walking in the ſteppes thereof, the ceremonies were onely ornamentes and outward helpes to the ſame. After which manner the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes alſo do interprete the law. For when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preferred the ceremonies and maner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the morall dueties and faith.

Therefore theſe outward thinges are not the maine ſubſtance but onely faith and loue. Hereof it is that the ſpirite of God commendeth the<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 1.15. Coloſſ. 1.4. 1.

And this we find to be in iij. ſorts in regard of the maner of gouernment, in the diſpenſation of iij. diuerſities of times, &amp; yet but in one rule of faith &amp; religion. The times were theſe. 1. From the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God made to Adam, vntil the giuing of the law in mount Sinay or Horeb, during the ſpace of 2513. yeres. 2. From the giuing of the law vntil the preaching of Io. Bap. and ſending of the Apoſtles to preach to all the world about ſome 1445. yeres. 3. From that<note n="*" place="margin">That is 30. yeres after Chriſt birth.</note> time to our daies ſom 1569. yeres, &amp; this is to continue till the end of the world, when Chriſt ſhal come again to iudge the quick and dead. In the firſt the maner of gouernment in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ouer whom it was extended: they were the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt world &amp; al the whole world of al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; languages, &amp; in regard of the things then in vſe,<note place="margin">Read Gen. 3.4.6.8.9.12. Rom. 3.1.9.4.5</note> they had not the law of God nor any part of his word written, but were taught &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; dreams from heauen, &amp; many were endewed with the ſpirit of propheſie. In the ſecond the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernment touching the perſons was this:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13587:19"/>
they were one nation called laſtly Iews, firſt Iſraelits and ſomtime Hebrewes, and in regard of the things, they had Moſes law written and ſo preſerued in bookes for the perpetual vſe of the church; and this law was in three ſorts, the morall written in two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhewing in ten words all dueties to God and man: the ceremonial law conſiſting in ordinances of rites, ſacrifices and the leuiticall prieſthood, by which order it pleaſed God in thoſe daies to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly worſhipped: &amp; the iudicial law which were ciuil lawes and ſtatutes, for the puniſhment of euill doers and ordering of the common wealth of that people, as was moſt fit for the time, for the true and holie religion. And vnder theſe three they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned vntill the comming of Chriſt. And becauſe they often times fell away vnto idolatrie, God raiſed vp prophets, to bring them to repentance, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them according to the law, &amp; ſhewed them alway the true faith and religion, with the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maner of gouernment. Now<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 2.11.12.</note> while that the church was in this one nation of the Iewes, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils (which are all the nations and languages of the worlde beſide) were left out from being the people of God, &amp; of his viſible church, which thing began at the circumciſion of Abraham, in that God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, did call it the couenant, that is a ſigne of the couenant, namly that Abraham and his ſeed ſhould be the people or church of God, and they that were not circumciſed ſhold be none of his church, which being ſome 400. yeres before the giuing of the law, in that ſpace the ſin of the gentils came to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and ſo the Iewes were then and thenceforth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13587:19"/>
diſtinctly knowen to bee of a differing religion and faith concerning God, from all people vnder heauen whatſoeuer.<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.1.2.3.4.</note> The third ſort in regard of the perſons are the gentils that is all nations and languages after the comming of Chriſt, and in regard of the things, they had the goſpel, which Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of GOD being made man of the virgin Marie, did preach, ordaine, and commit to writing, to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the euerlaſting benefit of the church which being preached by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as well to the Iewes as to the Gentils, at his commaundement and by his commiſſion: the Iewes for their vnbelefe fel away, and being left to the hardnes of their hart, were reiected, and ceaſed to be the viſible church of God, &amp; remaine ſcattered ouer the face of the whole earth vntill this day; and the gentils hearing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the goſpell and ſubmitting them ſelues by faith vnto the doctrin of Chriſt, became Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againe, and his viſible church, and ſo the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath remained among the gentils in one place or other vntil this day, and of this number are we of the church of Englande one happie part: The Lord our God, and merciful father in Ieſus Chriſt be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now in all theſe times, notwithſtanding that the outward face of the church, by the ceremonies and maner of gouernment, did verie much differ: yet in all theſe was but one ſubſtance of religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the knowledg of one true and liuing God, and in the worſhip of his diuine maieſtie, by faith in the holy promiſe of Ieſus Chriſt: which promiſe was made vnto Adam, Abraham, and Dauid, declared
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13587:20"/>
by the prophets &amp; preached to the gentils in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For ſo Adam<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 4.1.2.3</note> trained vp his ſons by ſacrifice to worſhip God, arguing their expectation of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias or ſeed of the woman to come. And therfore<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 11.2.3.4.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Enoch, Noe, &amp; Abraham are wel reported of, for their faith and to haue pleaſed God.

               <p n="4">4. Now to conclude this place we may obſerue, the wonderful adminiſtration of God, in vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13587:20"/>
of this one true religion &amp; faith of Chriſt in all ages of the world; and that in two things.

So that we, to the ſtirring vp of our thankfull hearts, to praiſe our good God, may ſay with the Pſalmiſt<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 147.20.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with euerie nation, neither haue they knowne his iudgements.</hi> And in this treatiſe concerning the firſt of the three times of the world, which was of the fathers before the lawe or any part of Gods worde was written, I make ſpeciall choiſe of Abraham for two cauſes. Firſt becauſe that in the hiſtorie of the fathers before his time, which containeth ſome 2083. yeares, the holy Ghoſt is verie briefe, and therefore not ſo full and plaine in diuers pointes, as after in the ſtory of Abraham. Howbeit thou ſhalt find in the ſame, the doctrine of one God, the trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, promiſe of Chriſt, and ſaluation to come by faith in him, Baptiſme, of the arke &amp; ſacrifices for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſacrament, ſeales of the couenant, and of dueties, diuers examples in Abell, Sheth, Enoch, Noe, and great puniſhments for the contrarie, ſo that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is one and the ſame, though that it be after more largely and particularly taught in the ſtorie of Abraham. But becauſe my purpoſe is to ſhew, that the particular partes of the doctrine of our religion bee moſt auncient and catholike, I finde it more fitte to take the patterne from Abraham, in whoſe ſtorie I may gather theſe thinges more plainely, and alſo many moe ſeuerall braunches
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13587:23"/>
thereof. But my ſecond cauſe is more ſpeciall and of greater wayght, namely that God made choiſe of Abraham in calling of him, to bee the father of all belieuers, and that the ſame faith which hee receyued of God, ſhould bee the religion of all nations wherein and whereby they ſhould bee ſaued to the end of the world. Which thing Saint Paule teacheth when hee ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſcripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that God woulde iuſtifie the gentilles through faith, preached before the Goſpell vnto Abraham ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, In thee ſhall all the gentils bee bleſſed.</hi> Where we learne that the goſpell which teacheth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that men ſhould bee iuſtified by faith was preached to Abraham, and namely for the vſe of the gentilles, that they ſhould bee made of the ſame religion with Abraham, and with him by faith onely bee iuſtified: as hee ſaith in the next verſe:<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>So then they which be of faith are bleſsed with faithfull Abraham.</hi> This did GOD ſignifie vnto Abraham, when hee chaunged his name ſaying,<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17.45.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold I make my couenant with thee and thou ſhalt bee a father of many nations, neither ſhall thy name any more be called Abraham, but thy name ſhall bee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, for a father of many nations haue I made thee.</hi> Hereof the Apoſtle teacheth that Abrahams ſeede is twofold<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> not onely of the law (which is meant of the Iewes) but alſo that which is of the faith of Abraham (that is the gentilles, who not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawe, are yet his ſeed through faith) and therfore he addeth, <hi>He is father of vs all</hi> (that is both of Iew &amp; gentil which belieue) alleadging this place
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13587:24"/>
for proofe ſaying as it is written, <hi>I haue made thee a father of manie nations &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly proued, that Abraham is made, in regard of faith and religion, a father both to Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils. The Iewes are firſt admitted to be his children, to walke in his religion and ſteppes of faith: &amp; after we ſucceed in their roome to walk in the ſame ſteps of faith &amp; religion of Abraham: they as the Apoſtle els where<note n="c" place="margin">cap. 11.17.18.</note> ſaith being naturall braunches, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe were cut off: But we though braunches of the wild Oliue are grafted in by faith. Now becauſe it is here manifeſt, that Abraham receiued the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for vs, and the whole religion of God, as well for vs as for the Iewes, and that God wold not haue the Iews to haue one religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the gentils an other, the one to be ſaued by one faith, &amp; the other by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but both to be of that faith and religion which was taught and found in Abraham: and that Chriſt comming of his ſeed, ſhould bee ſauiour both of Iewes and gentils,<note n="d" place="margin">Luc. 2.32.</note> 
                  <hi>A light to be reuealed to the gentils &amp; the glorie of Iſrael:</hi> religion then being one, &amp; the ſame one being the ſame only which was taught A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, I thought it beſt to chooſe him and his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe that neither the law nor the goſpel could or ought to differ in religion and faith, from that of Abraham: that if our religion in Englande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that of Abraham, then it might bee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be the true auncient and catholike religion and faith, &amp; no new broached religion or doctrine, ſuch as that is of the Church of Rome, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this booke ſhall be ſeene.

                     <hi>the promiſe of the ſpirit,</hi> which thing you ſhall perceiue if you looke vpon Abrahams ſeed, for it came not by the naturall vertue and power of man, but by the holy Ghoſt, as firſt Iſaacke was borne, (when Abraham and Sarah were paſt age, of the naturall begetting and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of a child) by the vertue of the promiſe of God, which being performed by the power of the holy ghoſt, he is ſaid ſometime<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 9.7.8.

                     <hi>to be borne by promiſe,</hi> and ſometime <hi>to be borne after the ſpirit.</hi> Secondly Chriſt the ſeed of Abraham, by whom all are made bleſſed, is alſo borne a man without the ſeed &amp; begetting of any man, onely of a virgin, and conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, as the<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 1.34.35.</note> Angell in Luke declareth.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13587:25"/>
Laſtly, all the faithfull which are the ſpirituall ſeed and children of Abraham, and made bleſſed by this promiſe of Chriſt, are no otherwiſe made partakers of this bleſſing, but by the holy ghoſt as Chriſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 3.5.</note> expoundeth, ſaying; <hi>No man can enter into the kingdome of God, except he be borne againe by the holie ghoſt.</hi> Abraham doubtles, being taught the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words who ſpake, and of whom, and what maner of promiſe this was, and how it ſhoulde be performed, could not but behold therin, &amp; learne the moſt excellent miſterie and doctrine of the trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in this ſence and meaning doth the church of England hold this article of religion with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, as may appeare, not onely by the vniuerſall and notorious knowledge of our profeſſion, but alſo by fower Creedes, ſet downe in the booke of Common praier to be heard, learned and confeſſed of all men, <hi>The Apoſtles creed, Te Deum, Athanaſius creed,</hi> and the <hi>Nicen creed,</hi> and in the firſt article of religion agreed vpon by our church, and eſtabliſhed by lawe: Ann<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1562.

This ſtory ſheweth the decree of god, &amp; nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching the ſaluation &amp; damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, that as Abraham and Sarah diuerſly regarded Iſmael, and thought he might be the ſeed (as appereth by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s intreaty &amp; griefe for him, &amp; Sarahs laughing) yet were they altogether deceiued of their mind and will: but Iſaack, whom God decreed to be of Sarahs bodie, and ſo promiſed, became in deed, to

This durſt I neuer ſo interpret of mine owne head (nor many other places of like ſort in this treatiſe) but that the holy ghoſt, the ſame ſpirit, wherby God taught Abraham; hath opened it, in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as by the holy Apoſtle is plainly ſhewed: where it is thus ſaid.<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9 6.7.8.9. &amp;c.</note>

For this is a word of promiſe, in this ſame time wil I come, and Sarah ſhal haue a ſon. Neither he only felt this, but alſo Rebecca, when ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by one, euen by our father Iſaack: for ere the children were borne, and when they had neither done good nor euil (that the purpoſe of God might remaine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to election, not by workes but by him that calleth) it was ſaid vnto her the elder ſhal ſerue the yonger,</hi> as it is written, <hi>I haue loued Iacob and hated Eſau, what ſhal we ſay then is there vnrighteouſnes with God?

that time of their firſt ingrafting into the couenant, to bee made Gods people, vnto the time of a childe newly come into the world.

Abraham our father: For firſt he was taught it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly hee found and felt it. Thirdly God wrote it for euer, with great and golden letters in the image of his houſe, that all poſteritie might reade it, and learne it, to their euerlaſting comfort. That he was taught it, is apparant in that God finding him void of all goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe (as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) gaue him the promiſe, that<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 12.3.</note>

                     <hi>What ſhall we ſay that Abraham our father hath found concerning the fleſhe? for if Abraham were iuſtified by workes, hee hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God. For what ſaith the ſcripture, Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, and it was counted to him for righteouſnes.</hi> In which wordes it is plaine, that Abraham was iuſtified by faith onely, and if hee had beene by workes hee had had no reioycing with God. And as touching all other, that it is the onely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall rule of iuſtification, hee ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Now it is not written for him onely that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe: but alſo for vs to whom it ſhall be imputed for righteouſneſſe, which beleeue in him which rayſed vp Ieſus our Lorde from the dead.</hi> Thirdly, the great and golden letters wherewith this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is written in Abrahams houſe, be Sarah his wife and her ſonne Iſaack, and Hagar his bond ſeruant and her ſonne Iſmael: in whom God hath ſet forth as in a wide open book, the two couenants: the couenant of works and the couenant of mercie, the one of the law and the other of the goſpell. For Sarah repreſenteth the couenant of mercie, and the eſtate of the Church vnder the goſpell; and her ſonne the true and faithfull beleeuers in Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Read Gen. 16. &amp; 21.</note> Hagar repreſenteth the couenaunt of workes, and the ſtate of the Church vnder the lawe, and her ſonne Iſmael ſuch as ſeeke righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by their workes. Now as Sarah being the free woman, her ſonne Iſaack was the heire vnto Abraham, and remayned in his houſe for euer: ſo the couenaunt of mercie, and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13587:39"/>
ſtate of the Church vnder the goſpell being free, the true beleeuers, being children of that church, are iuſtified through faith, made heires of God, through hope, and remaine in Gods houſe for euer. And as Hagar being a bondſeruant, her ſonne could bee no otherwiſe but a bond ſlaue, and ſo both were caſt out of Abrahams houſe for euer. So the couenant of workes and the eſtate of the church vnder the law (in them which ſought righteouſnes any where but in the promiſe made afore vnto Abraham) in as much as no man is able to performe the law: engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth vnto the bondage of ſinne, death, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as many as ſeeke to bee iuſtified by their workes are vnder the curſe, and therefore to bee caſt out of Gods houſe for euer, euen as in the examples of Iewes and gentils the Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainely.<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 9.30.</note> 
                     <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? that the Gentils which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not righteouſnes, haue attained vnto righteouſneſſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the righteouſnes which is of faith. But Iſrael which followed the law of righteouſneſſe could not attaine to the law of righteouſnes: wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but (as it were) by the workes of the law.</hi> Here I do humbly confeſſe, that I ſhould neuer haue beene able to haue read this doctrine, in theſe great letters, if the hand of the maſter builder, the Apoſtle of the gentils, had not pointed it out vnto mee, by the finger of Gods ſpirit. For in the Epiſtle to the Galathians: hauing proued and declared by many arguments, that we are iuſtified by faith, and not by workes at all, and ſhewing the vſe of the law to bee ſo farre from iuſtifying by workes, that it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely to driue vs from works vnto Chriſt, to be

iuſtified by faith in him. At the length he calleth his reader to looke vpon this table, wherin this doctrine is purtraied, in the houſe of Abraham, and ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreteth it, that euerie nouice in religion may perceiue it, ſaying:<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Tell me, ye that will be vnder the law, do ye not heare the law, for it is written that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had two ſonnes, one by a ſeruant, and one by a free woman: but he which was of the ſeruant was borne after the fleſh, &amp; hee which was of the free woman was borne by promiſe. By the which things an other thing is ment; for theſe mothers are the two teſtaments, the one which is Agar of mount Sina, which gendereth vnto bondage, (for Agar or Sina is a mountaine in Arabia, &amp; aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Hieruſalem which now is) &amp; ſhe is in bondage with her children, but Hieruſalem which is aboue is free, which is mother of vs all, &amp;c.</hi> Now (that we may heare Moſes conſent) this verie doctrine doth the law it ſelfe teach. For although it be called the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie<note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 3.9.

Who firſt are vnable, either with<note n="d" place="margin">Verſe. 24.

                     <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is euerie one which continueth not in all the wordes of this law to do them.</hi> And ſecondly without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace of God wee cannot vſe the law of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for there<note n="g" place="margin">Cor. 3.13.14.</note> hangeth a vaile of ignorance and hardnes of heart ouer our eyes, in reading of the law, that we can not ſee the end why the law ſerueth; and ſo we are enthralled as were the Iewes, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth: <hi rend="sup">h</hi>

                     <hi>The righteouſnes of God is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt without the law, hauing witneſſe of the law and the prophets, to wit, the righteouſneſſe of God by faith of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto all and vpon all that beleeue.</hi> And this ſeruice of the lawe vnto the goſpell, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witneſſe the Apoſtle moſt liuely expreſſeth where hee ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Is the law then againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God? God forbid. For if there had beene a law which could haue giuen life, ſurely righteouſneſſe ſhould haue beene by the law, but the ſcripture hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe by the faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhoulde bee giuen to them that beleeue.</hi> Whereby you may learne that the lawe is ſo farre from iuſtifying, that thereby it ſhould hinder the iuſtifying by faith onely in the promiſe: that it determineth all men to bee ſinners, and maketh it manifeſt, that if wee deſire to bee iuſtified, we muſt runne to the promiſe by faith in Ieſus Chriſt. And in another place he ſheweth a further witneſſe of the law, ſaying:<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> 
                     <hi>The law entred that the offence might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, neuertheleſſe where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more.</hi> Whereby he teacheth vs two thinges: firſt that the law making ſinne appeare, &amp; (as hee ſaith els where)<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 7.13.</note> out of meaſure ſinfull,

was a ſchoolemaſter to driue men to Chriſt, that beleeuing in him they might bee righteous, by not imputing their ſinnes. The ſecond, that by ſo much, as by the law man ſeeth his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and curſed eſtate for breaking the law, by ſo much the more aboundantly doeth appeare vnto him the rich grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt. And this is not all the witneſſe of the lawe. For all the prieſthoode of Aaron and of the Leuites, the Tabernacle, Altars, the Arke and all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſacrifices, waſhinges, feaſtes, &amp;c.

                     <hi>For this cauſe is Chriſt the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new teſtament, that through death, which was for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were in the former teſtament, they which are called: might receiue the promiſe of eternall inheritance.</hi> So did the<note n="g" place="margin">1.

That as they had nothing in or of themſelues, to eaſe them or free them from preſent death, and God cauſed this braſen ſerpent to be ſet vp, that by onely looking thereon, they ſhould be healed: ſo did it ſignifie that by onely faith in Ieſus Chriſt, the ſting of ſin being done away

For if by the law and good workes wee all haue been iuſtified, it had been their due place, to haue ioined them in that article of iuſtification, and to haue honored them with the glorie of merite and deſeruing: but becauſe we men are ſo corrupt that in this life, our good workes, attaine not, to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which the law exacteth: wee muſt graunt

to follow God: Secondly, he contentedly abode in the land of Canaan as in a ſtrange land, and walking from place to place remained in tentes, and in euerie place ſhewed his godly deuotion in making an altar, and calling vpon the name of the Lord:<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 13.8.</note> he kindly yeelded to his nephew Lot,<note place="margin">&amp; 14.19.</note> for auoiding of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">&amp; 24.1. &amp; 18.23. &amp; 20.17.</note> charitablie reſcued him when hee was taken priſoner: carefully prouided a wife for his ſonne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack: feruently intreated for the Citie of Sodom, &amp; meekly praied for him that had taken away his wife:<note place="margin">&amp; 23. &amp; 25.</note> decently prouided for his wiues buriall: and wiſely before his death ſet an order betweene his children, concerning his ſubſtance, according to Gods word.

his woorkes, and through the workes the faith was made perfect: and the ſcripture was fulfilled which ſaith, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes &amp;c.</hi> Heere I am enforced, becauſe of S. Iames maner of ſpeaking, to clere a doubt before I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point. For in as much, as Saint Paul<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that Abraham was not iuſtified at all, by workes, but by faith without workes: and heere ſaint Iames ſeemeth to auoutch the contrarie, ſaying, was not Abraham our father iuſtified through workes: it is to be conſidered how theſe two may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. For the clearing of which difference. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that in deed they both vſe one worde, but not in one meaning, nor to one and the ſame ende: For Saint Paul by this woord (iuſtified) meaneth, that God freely imputeth righteouſnes vnto him as nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,<note place="margin">Read Rom. 4.1.4.5.6.15.16. and cap. 3.24.25.28.</note> 
                     <hi>iustified by faith,</hi> in ſaint Pauls mind is as much as to ſay: <hi>righteouſnes is imputed vnto him for his beleefes ſake, and for nothing elſe.</hi> And his end was to prooue that no man can be iuſtified by workes in the ſight of God, but that this bleſſednes to bee iuſte before God, commeth by faith without workes. But Saint Iames hauing to doo with ſuch as boaſted of faith, and tooke to them ſelues licence to ſin, had this end; namely, to proue, that faith without workes was in deed no faith properly, and in the ſight of God but a dead faith, and therfore by this word iuſtified mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely this, that by workes a man is declared and made knowen, tn be iuſtified by faith, that is, that he hath not a vaine, dead and fruitles faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that Abraham was ſo iuſtified, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and made knowen to be a iuſt man, of a true
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13587:48"/>
and liuely faith, teſtified by ſuch a notable woorke: he being our father we muſt be found to haue ſuch a woorking faith: or els we cannot be knowen, to bee any other but hypocrites, of a dead and counterfait faith. And that this is the true and proper meaning of Saint Iames: Firſt conſider, that this word (iuſtified) is diuerſly vſed, and to be taken in the holy ſcriptures (as all other wordes be) according to the ſcope and purpoſe of euerie place. For <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> where he ſayth:<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6.7.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is dead is iuſtified from ſinne;</hi> there it ſignifieth to be free, as it is by ſom tranſlated. And in<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 7.29.</note> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> it is ſaid that the Publicans iuſtified God, being baptized with the Baptiſme of Iohn; where it ſignifieth, to praiſe God for his mercy, goodnes, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. In<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 11.19.</note> Mathew it is ſaid: <hi>Wiſedome is iustified of her children;</hi> where it ſignifieth acknowledged or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed or declared iuſt. In which places this worde of neceſſitie hath ſuch ſence and meaning, as the ſcope of the ſeueral places aforde. So here Saint Iames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being, to teach the vanitie of him, that boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of faith, and yet liueth wickedly; by all reaſon muſt be vnderſtood to meane by the word iuſtified, the declaring of the righteouſnes of his faith, by his workes. And this wil eaſilie appeare, if you marke his propounding of this queſtion, the order of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and his concluſion. Firſt his propoſition, verſ. 14. <hi>What auaileth it my brethren, though a man ſaith he hath faith, when he hath no workes? can the faith ſaue him?</hi> where you may perceiue, he ſpeaketh againſt pratlers and hypocrites, which ſay they haue faith: and ſecondly that ſuch a faith which is onely in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bringeth foorth no woorkes cannot ſaue:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13587:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where you are to note that he propoſeth to himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the confutation of a vain and idle faith, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſaying, and that he doth not enter to entreat of this queſtion; whether faith onely (being true and liuely) do iuſtifie, or ſo far to prefer workes, that they iuſtifie or ſaue vs, with or without faith. And this meaning doth all the order of his reaſoning declare: Firſt ver. 15.16.17. where he teacheth, that as to make a ſhew of liberalitie in wordes, and in deede to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nothing, doth beway but a counterfait liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <hi>So faith without woorkes is dead in it ſelfe,</hi> where marke that he ſaith, in it ſelfe, or by it ſelfe: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſheweth that if it were the true iuſtifying and liuely faith in it ſelfe, it would bring foorth liuelie fruits to declare the ſame: and hereupon he openeth the meaning of his propoſition ver. 18. that a man is to ſhewe his faith by his workes, namely that it is a thing, which a man will aske for, of him that ſaith he hath faith: then ver. 9. he ſheweth that ſuch an idle faith, is that of the diuell, which beleeueth there is a GOD and trembleth: So theſe vaine pratlers may haue a generall beleefe, and ſometime tremble to thinke vpon Gods power, and yet neuer haue the true faith in Ieſus Chriſt which iuſtifieth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with whoſoeuer is rightly endowed he hath Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. ver. 9.10.</note> dwelling in him by his ſpirit, by whom the bodie of ſinne is ſlaine, and the life of righteouſnes is as it were a new created: as it is ſaid elſe where,<note n="b" place="margin">2.

the ſtorie of Abraham, offering vp his ſonne, vpon this propoſition and order of reaſoning: and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prefixing theſe woords, <hi>But wilt thou vnderſtand O thou vaine man, that faith without workes is dead.</hi> What other thing can hee meane by the woord (iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,) except he abruptlie goe contrarie to all his owne former ſpeech, but onlie the declaring, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making knowen of his faith, not to bee dead, vaine or onelie in ſaying, and not that workes make a man iuſt before GOD, which appeareth by his reaſon in this example, in that he ſayth: <hi>Faith wrought with his workes and through workes was faith made perfect,</hi> which ſignifieth that in offering vp of his Sonne; his faith wrought to bring foorth this worke, and that this worke being atchieued, it made manifeſt that hee had a true and perfect faith, his workes then in Saint Iames meaning, perfected his faith, that is made it appeare perfect, but it did not meddle with the making of the man Abraham to be iuſt and righteous in the eies of GOD by that worke ſo wrought. And then adding: <hi>The ſcripture was fulfilled which ſaith, Abraham beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes;</hi> he vnderſtandeth that the offering vp of his Sonne, did make manifeſt that Abraham beleeued in deede and a right: and therefore that ſcripture was approoued true: that God imputed righteouſnes to him (not for a vaine ſaying and hypocriticall diſſimulation) but for a true beleefe and an vnfayned faith in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In the ſame ſenſe, verſe 25. hee alleageth the ſtorie of Rahab. Nowe laſtely the concluſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13587:50"/>
by a compariſon, of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be dead, which hath not a ſpirit that ſo faith without works is dead: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is a ſpiritual working of faith, which if it appeare not by works, it declareth that faith is dead in it ſelfe. So that Saint Iames ſpeaketh onely againſt a dead faith, meaning not, by any termes to derogate from a liuely faith, as though it had helpe of workes in the matter of iuſtification before God. Further if we conſider the ſtory of Geneſis out of which it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you ſhall finde that Saint Iames could not haue any other meaning. For it was before<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 15.16. &amp; 17.11.25. &amp; 21.5. &amp; 22.</note> Iſmaell was borne, that Abraham was iuſtified by his faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of workes: Then Iſmaell was fourteene yeeres ould when Iſaack was borne, and Iſaack was of ſome pretie yeres, that he was able to beare a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of wood wherewith he ſhould haue been bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; therefore it muſt needs be between twentie and thirtie yeeres, after the time of Abrahams iuſtifying, that he offered vp Iſaack: which being ſo, it cannot be vnderſtood, that that worke iuſtified him, leaſt it ſhould deſtroy and<note n="b" place="margin">Read Rom. 4 10.11. &amp; Gal. 3.17.</note> diſanul his iuſtifying by faith ſo long before. And therfore God himſelfe doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the power and vſe of this worke, not any whit to iuſtify him, but only to make his faith to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: where hee ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 22.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Now I knovv that thou fearest God: ſeeing for my ſake thou hast not ſpared thine onely ſonne.</hi> And therefore doth the holy ghoſt interpret it thus.<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 11.17.</note> 
                     <hi>By faith Abraham offered vp Iſaack when hee was tried &amp;c.</hi> teaching vs that this was a fruit of the iuſt mans faith, and not a worke to make him iuſt or meritorious in Gods ſight. Therefore we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13587:50"/>
conclude, that Saint Iames in ſaying; Abraham was iuſtified by workes when he offered vp his ſon doth onely contend for this, that it was of neceſſitie, that faith ſhoulde be declared and made knowen by woorkes, becauſe our father Abraham did ſo, by workes ſhew himſelfe to be iuſtified by faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we his children are baſtards and not ſons, if our faith be idle and vnfruitful, euen as Chriſt ſaith to the Iewes:<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 8.39.</note> 
                     <hi>If ye were Abrahams children ye would doe the workes of Abraham,</hi> which wordes doe directly ſhew this article, we haue in hand. Firſt that Abraham did workes approouing his faith: and ſecondly that this alſo is to be looked for of his children (that is of all beleeuers) that they quite themſelues to haue a true faith, by their good life and obedience to God: or els they bee no beleeuers, or children of Abraham. The ſame faith doth the church of England profeſſe namely:<note n="b" place="margin">Articl. 12. of good workes.</note> 
                     <hi>Good woorkes are the fruits of faith, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after iustification: they doo ſpring out neceſſarily of a true and liuely faith, in ſo much as by them, a liuely faith may be as liuely knowen, as a tree diſcerned by the fruit,</hi> and againe;<note n="c" place="margin">Apolog. cap, 20. diuiſ. 1.</note>

                     <hi>A ſonne honoureth his father and a ſeruant his Maſter; If then I bee a father, where is my honour? and if I be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter where is my feare &amp;c.</hi> Nowe we know that wee are ſonnes no way but by faith: Therefore this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet intendeth, that we are not ioined to the Lorde by faith, either as his people, children or ſeruants, or that hee is our God, father and Lorde; except our deedes ſhew the vnfainednes of our faith, in honor and feare.

to be ſeene in the ſtorie of Abraham, that he had no ſauour of religion, before God taught him by his word, neither can wee find that he added any thing of his owne.

touching ſaluation, to be or to haue beene the word of God which may not be rightly gathered, taught or proued, confirmed or allowed by the writings of Moſes and the prophets in the old teſtament, and in the new teſtament by the Euangeliſtes and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Ieſus Chriſt. And this will appeare verie eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to the conſcience of all faithful and wiſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtians, if they conſider what the ſpirite of God teacheth in all theſe times.

Therefore the prophetes pronounce the ſame writinges to be a moſt perfect Canon, not to be added to nor taken from, ſaying after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:<note n="a" place="margin">Eſa. 8.20.</note> 
                     <hi>To the law and to the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And againe,<note n="b" place="margin">Malach. 4.4.</note>

Now becauſe, Moſes and the prophets agreed in their writinges, in declaring and making manifeſt the ſame truth and word of God, which he would haue to be the knowen canon and rule of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Our Sauiour Chriſt reiecteth all<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 15.3.</note> new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, writing, traditions and cuſtomes of men, &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to the<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 16.29. cap. 24.44.</note> law and the prophets, bidding vs to<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note> ſearch the ſcriptures.

                     <hi>The whole ſcripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach vs that the man of God may be abſolute, being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnto all good workes.</hi> What can be a more perfect rule or touchſtone, then that which is moſt ſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired of God, profitable euery way in righteouſnes, by which a man may be abſolute &amp; perfect vnto all good workes. And hereof it commeth, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the new teſtament are not a new Canon or additament of rule in religion, but onely a more plaine reuelation, &amp; fulfilling of that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taught by Moſes and the prophetes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhal find that Chriſt and the Apoſtles euery where do approue their doctrine by the teſtimonies of the ſcriptures, of the olde teſtament. Wherefore Paul acknowledgeth, that<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 16.26.</note> God commanded the preaching of the goſpell to bee by the ſcriptures of the prophets, and Peter<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 3.22.24.</note> appealeth to Moſes and to all the prophets from Samuel and thenceforth, that they foretold of thoſe daies, that is of the time of the goſpell, and the things which ſhould bee manifeſted therein. And therefore Paul proteſted that he<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 26.22.</note> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed both to ſmall and great, no other things then thoſe which the prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come. Wherefore the whole ſcriptures of the olde and new teſtament, is one and the ſame rule of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Although peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture (as is before declared) there may be ſome difference in ceremony and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernment, yet is the firſt euen in thoſe thinges a witneſſe of the laſt, and the laſt a true and faithfull expounder and fulfiller of the firſt. Hereof
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13587:55"/>
it is that Mathew and the other Euangeliſts do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all the doctrine and doings of Chriſt, by ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſcriptures. Yea thoſe thinges which in forme &amp; order differ, are yet proued, that ſo they ought to be by Moſes and the prophetes as the miniſterie of<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 3.3.</note> Iohn Baptiſt,<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2.16.</note> and of the Apoſtles,<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7.1.12.</note> the prieſthood of Chriſt, and his changing of the lawe,<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.9.13</note> prouiding for the miniſterie, though not by tithes, and many ſuch like. But as for the moſt ſubſtantiall parts of the doctrine of faith and ſaluation, I hope it ſhal appeare to the godly Chriſtian, by reading this Chapter throughout, that there is but one canon and rule of truth. Therefore to conclude, let the reader obſerue, that this writing of Gods word is done by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to this vſe and ende, that we might bee ſure to know, and how to trie, and finde out, what is the worde of God, by examining all things, wee heare, by the Canon of the ſcripture.

                  <p>IN this Article is a double deſcription of Chriſtes Church, firſt in regard of the nature, and ſecond, in regard of the viſible markes. The nature is in three things, vnitie, and vniuerſalitie, and faith: The markes are declared by their profeſſion, which is preaching and adminiſtring the word &amp; ſacraments. By vnitie wee vnderſtand, that God hath not diuers Churches of diuers ſectes, in diuers places or times, but howſoeuer times and places may haue ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and temporal differences, yet in all times and places, the people whom God alloweth and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to bee his church, are but one miſticall bodie, wherof Chriſt is the head: and as it were one ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, wherof Chriſt alone is ſheapheard. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of the fathers before the law, &amp; the Church of the Iewes vnder the law, and of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles vnder the goſpell, are not three Churches but one, in one felowſhip with God, by one Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt as it is written:<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>In euerie nation hee that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted with him.</hi> How be it in the diſpenſation of times, there is ſome difference: for it pleaſed God for the wickedneſſe of the nations, for a time to place his holy oracles &amp; couenantes in that one nation of the Iewes, vntill theſe laſt daies, when Chriſt came and tooke away the partition wall, and opened the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for all people to enter in, and to bee made one church with the Iewes. Yet although the ſinnes of the gentils did ſhut them out for a ſeaſon: God ſo diſpoſed it that the time of the fathers and Moſes &amp; the prophets do witneſſe that now in the end of the worlde they ſhould bee admitted into the ſame fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and no nation barred from being of the Church of God. The laſt point in the nature of the church is the chiefeſt, without which they cannot be the church: for it is Chriſt<note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 3.18.</note> that bringeth vs to God. And as S. Paul ſaith,<note n="d" place="margin">Ephe. 2.18.</note> we both (that is, Iews &amp; gentils) haue an entrance to the father by one ſpirit.

of God, and that the ſame is not ſhut vp (as in times paſt among the Iewes) into ſome one corner or kingdome, but that it is catholike and vniuerſall diſperſed through out the whole world. So that there is now no nation which may truely complaine, that they be ſhut out and may not bee one of the church &amp; people of God: and that this Church is the kingdome, the bodie and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and that Chriſt alone is the prince of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that Chriſt alone is the head of this bodie, and that Chriſt alone is the bridegroome of this ſpouſe.</hi> And againe:<note n="a" place="margin">Artic. 19. of the church.</note>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:13587:64"/>IN handling of this article, if I declare two things, (Firſt that theſe three times of the fathers, of the law &amp; of the goſpel, agree in the deſcription of the nature of a ſacrament: and herein that theſe two: Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper are only for the new Teſtament; and namely, according as they are here deſcribed &amp; no otherwiſe: And ſecondly that herein the church of England agreeth with the holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all theſe times, as a true obſeruer of Gods woord therein:) I ſhall ſufficiently prooue that the church of England holdeth the moſt auncient, true, and catholike faith. In the firſt there are three things to be ſhewed, the nature, the number, and the ſpecial difference of the ſacraments. In the nature wee ſee what is general and common to all Sacraments: and this is in two points: who made them, and whereof they conſiſt, the firſt is, they <hi>are ordained of God,</hi> and this is ſo farre off the nature of a ſacrament, that none can be ſo, without God be the author: for who can giue man a ſpecial ſigne and ſeale of Gods fauor &amp;c. but God himſelfe? amongſt men he is guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that will make a ſeale of a princes letters patents in the kings name, except he haue the ſeale deliuered him by the prince for that purpoſe: So and much more, for ſo much as God is more excellent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, then any prince of the earth, and his will more vnſearchable, and the freedom and glory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, more hie and heauenlie; no man may or can, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a ſacrament, to aſſure vs of Gods good will, whereof he hath no warrant or authority from God. For if (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>No man doth knowe the things of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>but the ſpirit of God?</hi> ſurely much leſſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13587:64"/>
can any man ordaine a Sacrament which is ſuch a thing, as by it we may be aſſured of Gods free grace and mercie in Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore you ſhall find that in all times, the church (ſo long as it was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and not idolatrous) neuer aduentured to make a Sacrament: as you may ſee in Abraham, who had ſacrifices and circumciſion, although we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that by the ſpirit of propheſie, he was inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe things, yet ſhall you alſo find that he had an<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 15.9. cap. 17.9.</note> expreſſe commandement. So Moſes in all the foure bookes of Exodus, Leuiticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomie, ſheweth plainely, that he ordained, neither paſſouer, nor any ſacrifice, or other ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but by expreſſe commandement of god. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when they ſhewed any ſigne of Gods good pleaſure, they gaue it by his authoritie and aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 7.18. &amp; 37.22.30. and 38.7.</note> Eſaiah vnto Ahaz and vnto Ezekiah,<note n="c" place="margin">1.

And for the ſame Baptiſme to be perpetuall in the church, and alſo the Lords ſupper,<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 22.19. 1. Cor. 11.23. Matth. 28.19.</note> euerie one that readeth the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, muſt needs be verie negligent, if he do not perceiue, when and where they were commanded of God.</p>
                  <p>Nowe the ſecond thing in the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is whereof they conſiſt, and this all men know to be of an outward thing, which may be ſeene and diſcerned by the ſenſes: and of an heauenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing, which cannot be ſeene, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the vnderſtanding. The firſt is called a ſigne, becauſe it is not there to ſerue according to his owne proper nature, but to an other ſpecial vſe appointed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13587:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God, that is, to repreſent an other thing which it ſelfe is not: and not onely to be a bare ſigne, but alſo ſuch a ſigne as is a ſeale, which being ſet to a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth make it authenticall: ſo this is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſſure vs, of the partaking or hauing of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing it ſelfe, which this outwarde ſigne doth ſignifie. The thing ſignified or ſealed is the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mercie, which is in Chriſt: which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, that God promiſeth forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, righteouſnes and ſaluation, to all that beleeue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as is taught out of the prophet Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in the<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10.12.16.</note> Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, and I ſay: In Ieſus Chriſt, not onely becauſe, that (as is taught to the Galathians) <hi>The</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>couenant was confirmed of God in reſpect of Christ:</hi> but alſo becauſe, that (as is taught in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes)<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>by the death of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, wee receiue the promiſe of eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and ſo the Teſtament our couenant is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by the death of him that made the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore the ſacraments doo ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and aſſure vnto our ſoules, this couenant, as they doo applie vnto vs his verie death, his bodie broken, and his bloud ſhed, as the perfect ratifying and eſtabliſhing of the couenant: ſo that in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacraments, wee muſt by faith (as it were) waſh our ſelues with his bloud, and feede vpon his bodie and bloud, to the ſealing vp of our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluation, in the aſſurance of the couenant. And here is to be obſerued, that theſe thinges are to bee vnderſtood diſtinctlie; the ſigne, the thing ſignified, and wherein the power and operation of the Sacrament conſiſteth. The ſigne is not changed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13587:65"/>
into the thing ſignified, neither hath it the nature power or operation of the thing ſignified, but onely repreſenteth, &amp; as a ſeal applieth the thing ſignified: Secondly the thing ſignified is the verie matter of our happines, which is to be in couenant with God, engrafted, cleanſed, nouriſhed and ſtrengthened in Chriſt, vnto eternall life: but the power commeth of the inſtitution, that as God hath ordained them to be ſignes and ſeales, ſo they are in deed: and the working is of the holy ghoſt, for he by his ſpirit doth make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> effectuall in all beleeuers, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their faith in the holy couenant, and for the liuely applying and fruitfull feeling of the death, &amp; bloudſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt the mediator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this is to be all and the onely nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, may appeare in all times.</p>
                  <p>And firſt in Abrahams time, there is<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is of the fathers, the ſigne whereof is the cutting of the foreskin of the fleſh, and the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the couenant of God with Abraham, to bee his God and the God of his ſeede: It is not onely called a<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> ſigne of the couenant, but alſo<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 10.13.</note> the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: thereby to ſhew that it is not only a bare ſigne or token, but alſo an aſſurance, as a firme ſeale. And ſo Saint Paule interpreteth it ſaying:<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>After he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſigne of circumciſion as a ſeale &amp;c.</hi> Againe, here are three diſtinct things; the ſigne is not turned into the couenant, neither hath it the nature and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer nor the operation thereof. For the couenant is in the promiſe, and the ſigne doth repreſent that promiſe, and that promiſe reſpecting Chriſt, is the matter of Abrahams happineſſe, by which hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13587:66"/>
was made and<note n="a" place="margin">Eſai. 41.8.</note> called the friend of God. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this couenant in his fathers houſe could not but worſhip other Gods, and ſo was an enemie to God and therefore miſerable. And this appeareth as the Apoſtle teacheth, becauſe he<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 4.9.10.11.</note> was iuſtified by faith in Chriſt before he was circumciſed, and after recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſigne of circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a ſeale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the faith, which he had when he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed. Now the power, it had thus to worke as a ſigne and a ſeale, was of Gods inſtitution, who ordained it to be ſuch a ſigne and a ſeale: yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and effect, was onely by the holy Ghoſt, for els all men circumciſed ſhould haue beene hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and ſaued: and therefore the Apoſtle teacheth vs that he is not a<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 2.28.29.</note> Iew, which is one outward, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that circumciſion, which is outwarde in the fleſh, but he is one within, and the circumciſion is of the hart, in the ſpirit not in the letter, teaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the outward worke of cutting the fore skin hath no effectuall working, but when God by his ſpirit doeth circumciſe the heart, according to that comfortable ſpeech of Moſes:<note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 30.6.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord thy God wil circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, that thou mayeſt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoule, that thou maieſt liue.</hi>

Now the inſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet forth, and in all ſorts explaned by God, as the other ſacrament of circumciſion doth ſhew the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the thing ſignified in regarde of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture power &amp; operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as is before ſaid of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if there were difference, the Lord would haue mentioned it by ſome word or other. The like teach the prophets of the ſacrifice, as in the pſalmes it is ſaid: that the people make a<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 50.5.</note> couenant with God by ſacrifice. Where thou maieſt perceiue the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne acknowledging and auowching of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was by ſacrifice, as an outward ſigne teſtifying the agreement of both parties. And ſo God chargeth the people (in the time of Hieremie the prophet)<note n="h" place="margin">Hier. 34.18.</note> 
                     <hi>That they kept not the words of the couenant which they had made before him, when they cut the calfe in twain, &amp; paſſed betweene the parts thereof.</hi> So then you ſee that the couenant &amp; the wordes of the couenant is one thing, &amp; the ſacrifice is an other, euen a ſigne: yet not a naked &amp; bare ſigne but alſo a ſeale ratifying the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. And therfore<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 24.8.</note> Moſes did ſprinkle the bloud of the ſacrifice on the people ſaying: <hi>Behold the bloud of the couenant, which the Lord hath made with you:</hi> which vſe or power ſo to be, commeth of inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who ordained the ſacrifice to that end. But the operation &amp; effect to be onely of Gods ſpirit appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, becauſe that this people, though couenanting by ſacrifice, are found far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the pſalme &amp; place of Ieremy before alleadged, which yet is further opened by<note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 36.27.</note> Ezech. by whom God ſaith: <hi>I wil put my ſpirit within you, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13587:67"/>
cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and yee ſhall keepe my iudgements and doe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this maner are the ſacraments deſcribed in the new teſtament: as namely where it is ſaid:<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>By one ſpirit are we al baptiſed into one body, whether we be Iewes or Grecians, whether bond or free, and haue beene all made to drinke into one ſpirit.</hi> Where this phraſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one bodie, into one ſpirit, noteth the couenant of grace in Chriſt, that as members of one bodie, ſo are wee vnited in fellowſhip together, with God through Chriſt, by his ſpirite working faith in our hearts. <hi>Baptized,</hi> noteth the one ſacrament; and <hi>drinke,</hi> noteth the other, which is the Lords ſupper; a part which is one ſigne, ſet for the whole which are two ſignes, bread and wine, eating and drinking. Now when he ſaith, <hi>baptiſed into one bodie:</hi> that ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the vſe of baptiſme, is to be a ſeale to confirme the couenant vnto vs, and not onely to bee a bare ſigne: and this phraſe, <hi>drinke into one ſpirite,</hi> doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the ſame thing of the Lords ſupper: but making mention of the ſpirit he ſheweth that the effect and operation is of the holy ghoſt. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be ſigns, the thing ſignified, and the power and operation of them both. The ſignes, water waſhing, bread wine, eating and drinking: the thing ſignified, the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the couenant which is in Chriſt. The power is of this: that God ordained this baptiſme and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord to bee ſignes of ſuch importance, as to ſeale and confirme vnto vs the couenant of grace, but the operation is of the ſpirite of God, which maketh vs really, and in deede partakers of the things promiſed. So that there is no difference
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13587:67"/>
in our ſacraments, from the ſacramentes of the olde teſtament, and that you may perceiue it is euen ſo, examine with mee their inſtitution. Firſt Baptiſme is ordained by theſe wordes:<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 28.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Go &amp; teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the ſonne and the holy ghoſt.</hi> And againe,<note n="c" place="margin">Mark. 16.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Go yee into all the world and preach the goſpell to euerie creature, hee that ſhall beleeue and be baptiſed ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> Here firſt the couenant is publiſhed by teaching and preaching: then the parties receiue the couenant by beliefe: and laſtly the ſame is confirmed by baptiſme. As in the practiſe may appeare. Peter preacheth Chriſt, the people are pricked in heart, asking what ſhall we do, and he teacheth them by theſe wordes:<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 2.22.37.38.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent and be baptiſed euerie one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſsion of ſins, and ye ſhall receiue the gift of the holy ghoſt.</hi> Where the word<note n="e" place="margin">Metanoéſate.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent</hi> noteth out the chaunge of the mind, not onely vnto amendment of life, but alſo by turning vnto God by beliefe, and therefore to declare the ſame, ſometime beliefe is ioyned with it, as where it is ſaid,<note n="f" place="margin">Mark. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent and beleeue the goſpell,</hi> ſo that hereby hee biddeth them ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and conuert, as by faith they may receiue the couenant of grace in Chriſt: and then adding that they ſhould bee baptiſed in the name of Chriſt for remiſſion of ſinnes, hee teacheth that baptiſme ſhould bee vnto them an aſſurance of that couenant which contayneth remiſſion of ſinnes, which thing they ſhould perceiue by the gift of the holy ghoſt, accompanying the ſame. Hereupon Philip<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 8.36.37.</note> being demanded of baptiſme by the Eunuch before hee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13587:68"/>
baptized him required the acceptation of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by theſe wordes: <hi>If thou beleeueſt, thou mayeſt?</hi> And leaſt wee ſhould thinke any power to bee in this ſacrament, otherwiſe then the inſtitution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to bee a ſigne and a ſeale of the couenant, or that the worke wrought, that is the verie outwarde ſigne, being applyed by the miniſter, when he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or dippeth the perſon baptized, did effect the thing ſignified. Saint Peter doth<note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 3.21.</note> expound it ſaying; <hi>Baptiſme doth ſaue vs.</hi> But howe? <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but in that a good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto God &amp;c.</hi> That is, it is not the outward waſhing or worke of the miniſtrie, but Gods ſpirit working in our hearts faith, with a good conſcience receiuing the couenant, which ſaueth vs. And in this ſorte alſo Chriſt<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 22.19 1. Cor. 11.23.</note> inſtituteth his ſupper, the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt taking bread &amp; after thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing breaking it he ſaith, this is my bodie and then taking the cup he ſaith: <hi>This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud.</hi> Then ſecondly, for a commandement to his Church he ſaith, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me, &amp;c.</hi> where ordaining a ſacrament hee vſeth ſuch phraſes and maner of ſpeech, as God did in the ſame kind in the old teſtament: ſometime calling the ſigne ſignifying by the name of the thing ſignified, as when he ſaith, <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> And ſometime again, leaſt we might thinke it made a further change, then was of old in the ſacraments, he addeth, <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> by the latter making it a ſigne and holy memoriall of Chriſt and his couenant, and by the former making it more then a bare ſigne, euen a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13587:68"/>
ſeale of aſſurance vnto the faithfull beleeuers, with the ſame termes &amp; order as the ſacraments were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and inſtituted in the olde teſtament, as wee haue ſeene before in circumciſion, the paſſeouer and the ſacrifices. So then the ſigne, the thing ſignified, and the power and working, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine diſtinct in that verie manner and order, as is before declared in Baptiſme and all the other ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Now if any man would here preſſe vpon mee the change of times, that therfore the ſacraments of the new teſtament haue more power and vertue in the worke wrought, then they of the old: as though that now ſuch a grace were in the outward action of the miniſter, miniſtring the Sacraments in due forme, as was not in the ſacraments of the old teſtament. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that this can not be ſhewed by any wordes of the new teſtament. For if they alleadge that baptiſme is intituled, by the verie worke it ſignifyeth: as it is called:<note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The waſhing of the newe birth:</hi> and the bread in the Lordes ſupper is thus expreſſed by Chriſt: <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> Wee may anſwere that ſo and in the ſame ſence, circumciſion is called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, and the lambe the paſſeouer. And as in the old teſtament God openeth his minde, when hee calleth the ſame circumciſion by the name of a ſigne. So here doth the new Teſtament expreſſe the ſame meaning, as where Chriſt is ſaid to ſanctifie &amp; cleanſe his Church,<note n="d" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.26.</note> 
                     <hi>By the waſhing of water through the word.</hi> Where the water is not vnderſtoode to doe any thing of it ſelfe, but as it is ioyned to the word as a ſigne and ſeale therof: for Chriſt teacheth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13587:69"/>
directly that it is the<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 15.3.</note> word that cleanſeth vs. And as I ſhewed before Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>It is not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> (that is, the outwarde waſhing of water) <hi>that ſaueth vs.</hi> And againe, Chriſt calling the cup the new teſtament in his bloud, doth alſo to open his mind, adde this, <hi>as oft as wee drinke it we ſhould doe it in remembrance of him.</hi> And leaſt we ſhould dreame of a further power in our ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then in them of the old, Saint Paule doth of purpoſe teach the contrarie to the Corinthians, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that the read ſea and the cloud was vnto Iſrael that which baptiſme vnto vs: ſaying,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1.</note> 
                     <hi>They were all baptized vnto Moſes in the cloud and in the ſea.</hi> And that Manna and the rock was that vnto them, which the Lords ſupper is vnto vs, ſaying: <hi>And did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, and did all drinke the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall drinke, for they dranke of the ſpirituall rock, which followed them, and the rocke was Chriſt.</hi> Which may further appeare by his reaſon: notwithſtanding theſe ſacramentes they were ouerthrowne in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therefore they were but outward ſignes and ſeales effectuall onely in the beleeuers,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.11.</note> as is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Heb. 4.2. which being compared vnto vs by an equall compariſon, when he ſaith, <hi>Theſe are enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to vs, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>Now all theſe came vnto them for enſamples, &amp; were written to admoniſh vs.</hi> It muſt needs bee, that he maketh the vertue of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of both times equal, ſeeing that giuing the ſame termes to thoſe ſacraments which are giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours: he inferreth that if we doe as they did, wee ſhall haue the ſame puniſhment. And it ſoundeth that way that he ſaith a little<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 16.17.</note> after, that we by eating
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13587:69"/>
of our ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, are partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt and all members in one bodie. And that they which<note n="b" place="margin">verſ. 18.</note> eat of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, were alſo partakers of the alter: that is of the good graces of God in Ieſus Chriſt of whom the<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 9. &amp; 9. cap. 13.10.15.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a figure. Therefore it cannot be that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace or vertue ſhould bee in the ſacraments of the new Teſtament, aboue the ſacraments of the old. And where as ſome thinke, that in the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the bread is changed into the bodie of Chriſt, and ſo conſequently there ſhould bee a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, from the old ſacraments: this may not onelie be ouerthrowne, by this, that Chriſt followeth the ſame order and termes, in inſtituting of theſe which were vſed, in the inſtitution of the other, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſufficiently declared: but alſo becauſe the holie ghoſt by diuers other arguments doth make this moſt apparant, namely that the ſigne remaineth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the thing ſignified, and neuer changed into the ſame; Firſt hee ſaith:<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.26</note> 
                     <hi>As often as yee eat this bread and drinke this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till hee come.</hi> Where note, firſt: that in teaching vs the meaning of this Sacrament, hee telleth vs that it is a ſhewing of the Lordes death: a great oddes then from being his bodie. For it is one thing to ſhewe his death, and an other thing to make it his bodie: and leaſt it might bee taken, that both might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, hee openeth himſelfe ſaying: <hi>Till he come,</hi> thereby teaching that this is an outward teſtimonie of his death till hee returne from heauen where he now is, for it cannot be ſaid til he come, if he be there in preſence: &amp; yet more fully when he ſaith by eating
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13587:70"/>
this bread &amp;c. we ſhewe his death &amp;c. which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it manifeſt that this eating and drinking is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſigne and this ſhewing of his death is the ſignification, and the reaſon till he come, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is abſent in bodie, he hath left this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as a pledge and ſeale of his death till he come againe in his bodie: and therefore he calleth it bread<note n="a" place="margin">ver. 26.27.28.</note> three times in this place, and that euen then, when it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, after the woords (as they ſay) of conſecration. And laſt of all it is to be conſidered, that there is no ground or reaſon, reueiled by God in his woord, that the ſame maner of ſpeech, in the ſame kinde of thing; in the new Teſtament, ſhould differ from the old in ſignification and vſe. Secondly, when he ſaith <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my bloud,</hi> why may wee not as well take the cup to be changed into his bloud, as to ſay the bread is changed? ſeeing there is no more exception in the one then there is in the other. Thirdly if the heauens muſt containe him (as ſaint<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note> Peter ſaith) vntil the time that al things be reſtored, and that no where it is reueiled, that the conſecrating of the bread and wine is accepted, how can there be his bodily preſence? And to conclude, if he ſhall ſo come, as he was ſeene goe into heauen, (as the Angell<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 1.11.</note> taught the Apoſtles) and that wee muſt<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 24.26.27.</note> not beleeue them which ſay <hi>He is in ſecret places,</hi> but as Chriſt teacheth, hee ſhall come as the lightning commeth out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth vnto the Weſt: Then it muſt needs follow, that we cannot conſter or vnderſtand this any otherwiſe: but as the ſacraments of the old Teſtament, ſo our ſacraments of the new Teſtament, are onely ſignes and ſeales of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13587:70"/>
the couenant of mercie in Chriſt Ieſus: which the holie ghoſt doth vſe as holy miſteries, to ſtirre vp and quicken and encreaſe all good graces, and the worke of faith in vs, according to Gods free promiſe in the couenant. Now for the number of ſacraments: That in the new Teſtament, there are and ſhould bee but two Sacraments of the couenant: This will appeare if it be ſhewed that the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did ſhadow out theſe two onely, and that the new Teſtament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands no more. Firſt for Baptiſme; Saint Peter ſaith that the<note n="a" place="margin">1. Pe. 3.20.21</note> Arke of Noe was a figure of our Baptiſme: and Saint Paule<note n="b" place="margin">Coloſ. 2.11.12.</note> auowcheth that our Baptiſme is come in the roome and place of circumciſion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly touching the Lords ſupper, Chriſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, after he had eat the paſſouer, did thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the ſame ſucceeded the paſſouer, and that the paſſouer being fulfilled and finiſhed by his death ſhould giue place vnto his ſupper, or holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which is confirmed by the practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who euer after inſtructed the church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue this and leaue out that: as in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſeueral churches it doth &amp; may appeare. Againe that place 1. Cor. 10.1.2. comparing the cloud, going through the read ſea, the manna and rocke vnto our two Sacraments; ſheweth plainely, that the equitie of Gods proceeding; which vnder the law was figured in theſe two ſacraments, ſhould bee preſerued. Namely one, for the firſt entrie into the couenant, and an other, for the confirmation of the ſame; that although there were many, yet they had no more but the ſubſtance of theſe two, and therefore theſe two were to remaine perpetuall, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13587:71"/>
be in as great value and vſe vnto vs, as if they were manie. And I am fully perſwaded, that no honeſt man, by any learning can shew any place pregnant, either in the olde or new Teſtament, for any other third, or fourth, or more to be ſhadowed out in like maner as theſe two. Now in the new Teſtament, it is apparant that theſe two are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: by that which is alreadie ſpoken. But that there bee no other, let a man examine whatſoeuer is or may bee pretended, by this diffinition of a Sacrament, and the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wherein and whereby I haue declared and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the ſame, hee ſhal find they come ſhort and beſide the marke: for either, they lack a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from god, or els an outward ſigne, or els are not declared ſignes of the couenant: As for example if any would make penance a Sacrament, he ſhall find that God commanded not penance by ſatisfaction, but onely the ſatiſfaction, which is made alreadie by the bloud of Chriſt, and there is no ſigne appointed by God thereunto, if any other will make orders a ſacrament, he ſhall finde their wants the couenant of mercie; for that impoſition of hands in orders is a ſigne of the grace of the miniſterie, and not of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of ſaluation. If ſome other ſhould ſet foorth matrimonie for a ſacrament, there wants a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to make it a ſigne: ſecondly it is in no place any otherwiſe, but as (infinite other things) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and ſimilitude or metaphore: And ſo it may be truely ſaid of any thing elſe, which is colourablie thruſt vpon the church, by the name of a ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>Nowe laſtly the difference betweene Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper in ſealing of the couenant, is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13587:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Baptiſme is for the firſt ſanction of the couenant and entring into the church, <hi>A ſeale of our adoption &amp; regeneration,</hi> this was circumciſion to Abraham and his ſeed: and the cloud and read ſea was this vnto all Iſrael, who were led by the hand of Moſes. And that Baptiſme might be for the firſt ſanction of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and entring into the church, the Apoſtles were<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> commanded to preach, and to receiue ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, by Baptiſme into the church: and ſo<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2. &amp; 8. &amp; 10. &amp; 13. &amp; 14. &amp;c.</note> they by this marke ſeperated the chriſtians from others, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they firſt wonne them to the goſpell, as all examples of their practiſe do ſhew, ſo well knowen, as I neede not to reherſe them. But for the other part, you haue for regeneration theſe woords:<note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The waſhing of the new birth and the renewing of the holie ghost:</hi> and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption theſe woords:<note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3.26.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye are all the ſonnes of God by faith in Christ Ieſus: for all ye that are baptized into Christ haue put on Christ.</hi> Where the putting on of Chriſt by Baptiſme being alleaged to ſhew our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods ſons by faith, teacheth that Baptiſme is a ſeale of our adoption. And for this alſo, Baptiſme is but once miniſtred; becauſe we once enter into the church, and are but once borne againe and adopted to be Gods children. Then as for the Lords ſupper, that it is a ſeale of our communion in the couenant, theſe words directly shew:<note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The cup of bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the bloud of Christ? the bread which we break is not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Chriſt? for we that are many ar one bread &amp; one body, becauſe we al are partakers of one bred:</hi> where it is called communion &amp;c. becauſe by this ſacrament, we are confirmed in the participation of Chriſt, as by a true ſeale of the couenant, and aſſured to be of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13587:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bodie: As touching the continual ſtrength we haue hereby; the often receauing doth notifie the ſame, and the kindnes of creatures, the maner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and the nature of working. For we being dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſubiect to ſinne and weakenes, are here on, as on a banket to feede for our dailie inward ſtrengthning, and bread and wine familiarly ſhew vs, that Chriſt is the bread from heauen, and his bloud is the ioyfull wine to glad mans hart; which when Chriſt biddeth vs to vſe in remembrance of him, what is it elſe, but that, by the taking, eating, &amp; drinking of theſe things for ſuch an end, we ſhould ſtirre vp our harts, in the aſſurance of the forgiuenes of ſinnes, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall grace and mercie of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> which Paul confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth when he ſaith, <hi>we ſhew the Lords death &amp;c.</hi> For by it we are confirmed, ſo that we thereby profeſſe before all the world,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> that ſo we beleeue and are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that our ſauiour will come againe to receiue vs into glorie. And in that it is called (as before) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, what other woorking can it haue,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> but to ſtrengthen our faith, and to encreaſe in vs, euerie good gift by the ſpirit. And hereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith: <hi>we are made to drinke into one ſpirit:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, as we drink wine to cheriſh our fleſhie hart; ſo here we haue a ſpirituall drinking of Chriſts blood, to cheriſh our ſoules vnto eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the ſweet conſent of the old &amp; new Teſtament touching the holie Sacraments; what they are in nature, how many ought to be vnder the goſpell, and how theſe two differ in their ſpecial and particuler vſe. The confeſſion of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is altogether ſo, and of the ſame conſent. For as

                  <p>HOw the pride &amp; preſumption of man brought this great plague of many languages into the worlde, and thereby great ſeperation of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations, and diuerſities of religion, as<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth declare the originall; ſo the ſtory and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all times doo witnes. And as it cauſed great toile and contention among men: ſo it came to paſſe in tract of time, that the true religion was found but in one people and language, and that of Abraham and his ſeede the children of Iſrael. Howbeit when the fulnes of time was come, that the moſt glorious ſonne of God our bleſſed Sauiour, ſanctified all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto God by his death, then were all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 2.11. Eſai 45.23.</note> holie vnto the Lord, that <hi>Euerie toonge ſhould confeſſe, that Ieſus Christ is the Lord, vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God the father.</hi> Therefore what people ſo euer it pleaſeth God, to call to be of his church, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them his holie religion, the language of that very people, is made holie to the Lord, to talke of his woord, to confeſſe his name, to pray to his goodnes, &amp; to celebrate his heauenly worſhip. This appeareth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13587:73"/>
by the ſtorie of Abraham, being an<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 14.13. &amp; 11.16.</note> Hebrew, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Heber, that God reuealed his worde vnto him and his ſeede in the Hebrew tongue. In that tongue which was to them naturall and knowne, he and they vſed all their prayers and holy exerciſes: and in that tongue did Moſes &amp; the prophets write all the oracles of God. Saue onely when Iudah was in captiuitie, Daniell wrote ſome Chapters which concerned the Chaldeans &amp; all nations in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Calde, which they beſt vnderſtoode, and fitteſt at that time for all nations, the Emperor of the world being of that language: and by mixture with other people the Hebrew writings of the prophetes, do ſomewhat ſauour of the language of the people, among whom they dwelt. Therfore it doth appeare that God was carefull, as a matter beſt for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches edification, to haue his will reuealed vnto his people, in that tong they beſt vnderſtood. So when all the world in all nations was called by the goſpel, to know and worſhip the true and liuing God, then were the ſcriptures written in Greeke, (namely ſo much as then was written by the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes) which language was at that time the moſt<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 21 37.</note> common language of the worlde, in ſo much as all<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3.28.</note> nations are called Grecians in oppoſition to the Iewes and their language. Alſo God<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 2.</note> endued his Apoſtles with the gift of diuers tongues, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that gift it might bee made manifeſt, that all languages are ſanctified in Chriſt, and that hee thought it need, that euery country &amp; people ſhould worſhip him in their owne language. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13587:74"/>
the Prophet Daniel propheſying of theſe daies, directly ſaith:<note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>All people, nations and languages ſhall ſerue him.</hi> Hereupon Saint Paul, leaſt the vſe of gift of many languages, ſhould be abuſed, ſpendeth one<note n="f" place="margin">Cor. 14.</note> whole chapter about this matter: and therein tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that it was moſt to edification, that the prayers and exerciſes of Gods worſhip, ſhould bee in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage knowen to the vulgar and meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a thing ſo familiarly knowen, that I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate it.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN this Article are two ſpecials as mariage and the dutie to the magiſtrate: which two may be as an inſtance for all of like ſort: for in the firſt kind we vnderſtand to be meats, times, &amp; the maner &amp; order of many things both ciuil and ſeruing to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they are al left free, ſo that in al theſe things, God and his word hath giuen free liberty, &amp; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled his Church, but onely requireth an orderly comely vſe, directed to his glorie. And in the ſecond ſort is the duetie to parents, to husbands, to wiues, to children and ſuch like that no man vnder the colour of religion caſt away ſuch dueties. Therefore I will onely ſpeake of theſe two, which being well marked I hope the wiſe and carefull reader will ſee, what is the true duetie of religion in all. And firſt looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 12. &amp; 15 &amp; 20 &amp; 21. &amp; 25.</note> Abraham: he was a prophet, yet had he his firſt and ſecond wife, and by vertue of Gods promiſe, when he ſaid: <hi>So ſhal thy ſeed be,</hi> he was made ſtrong, euen in his old daies to beget many children, and it was not an vncleane thing vnto him though hee were a prophet ſo to bee maried. In Moſes and his prieſthood you ſee: that he being a prophet,<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cron. 23.14.</note> begat children, and the prieſts and Leuits had their wiues. So in the prophets it is found that they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from this benefite, for it is expreſſed that<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 8.1. Ezec. 24.15.16 2.

And where Ieremie is forbidden, it is expreſſed, not to bee in regard he was a prophet; but onely becauſe of the<note n="d" place="margin">Hier. 16.2.3.5.8.</note> troubles of his time: for which cauſe he is alſo forbidden the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13587:75"/>
&amp; of feaſting: becauſe that he might teach the people by ſuch ſpeeches, as by a figure in his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there great calamitie, which hung ouer their heades.</p>
                  <p>And in the new teſtament we know that the<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 8.14.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had wiues before their calling, and it is no where expreſſed, that they were forbidden to keepe them afterwardes, but rather the contrarie, as where Paul ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Haue we not power ta leade about a wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſiſter, as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Caephas?</hi> As touching the miniſters of the congregations, they were ſo farre from barring them from wiues, that they doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely preſcribe<note n="c" place="margin">1.

Tim. 4.1.2</note> doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and that<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> mariage is honourable among all men. Therefore in this point is the practiſe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſound and catholike, and our profeſſion the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and vnchangeable truth. For wee ſay<note n="f" place="margin">Artic. 32. of the mariage of prieſtes.

                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the Magiſtrate, you ſee in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, how hee kept onely the gouernment of his owne houſe, and how lowly and humbly he caried himſelfe in<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 12. &amp; 20.</note> Egipt and Gerar, where there were kings of the countrie: And Melchiſedeck, though
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13587:75"/>
he were prieſt of the moſt high God, vſurped not authoritie ouer other kinges, but being a figure of Chriſt, hee bleſſed Abraham for a ſpeciall miſterie, as is expreſſed and taught in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> ſhadowing the royall prieſthood of Chriſt aboue the prieſthood of Aaron. Therefore in this time religion abridged not any duetie, but rather fulfilled them. Moſes, when hee deſcribeth the order of a king ouer Iſrael, hee ſheweth that God would make a king ouer them. Where hee vſeth<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 17.14.15.</note> theſe wordes, in the perſon of all the people: <hi>I will ſet a king ouer mee:</hi> And againe vnto them: <hi>Thou ſhalt make him king ouer thee.</hi> There <hi>me and thee, containe all eſtates and orders eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> And ſo was Ioſhuah the firſt Captaine,<note n="k" place="margin">Ioſhuah. 1.18 &amp; cap. 3.</note> the commaunder of all, neither is there any ſillable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting any one eſtate more then other. When this came in practiſe in the time of the prophetes, were not the prieſtes and Samuel ſubiect to Saul.<note n="l" place="margin">1.

Did not they commaunde and order the building and repairing of the temple, place and diſplace high prieſtes, call the people to the pure worſhip of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the prieſts in the holy adminiſtrations? And they themſelues were ſubiect to none,<note n="m" place="margin">1.

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:13587:76"/>So our Sauiour Chriſt commaundeth to giue<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 22.21.</note> Caeſar his due, and to God his due: and though hee were Lord of all, yet becauſe his kingdome was not of this world,<note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 27.</note>

Therefore alſo the practiſe of our Church in this behalfe, is verie godly and beſeeming the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of God: and that we herein profeſſe is a moſt auncient and catholike veritie.

                  <p>The Lords name, I ſay, be praiſed: who hath bin ſo mercifull and gratious vnto this little Ileland, that paſſing ouer many greater, richer and mightier nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath ſet ſuch an eſpecial loue vpon vs, as he hath vouchſafed to preferre and exalt our nation aboue many other to be of his holie and catholike church, of the bleſſed communion of his ſaints, and a true member of his viſible people, vpon whom his name is called. That we may truely, iuſtly, and boldly ſay, that the religion which we follow and the faith and doctrine which wee confeſſe is the faith of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, the knowledge of the truth according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vnder the hope of eternall life, the verie true and onely way of ſaluation, which God and not man teacheth.

Which Moſes and the Prophets proclaimed, and maintained ſome 1445. yeeres vntill the bleſſed time of Chriſtes holie

And which the ſame Ieſus Chriſt the glorious ſon of God, euen the Lord of life, preached in his owne perſon, and his holie Apoſtles which heard him and ſaw al his great works did witnes and publiſh to all the gentils and was confirmed by gods holie teſtimonie from heauen, with great ſignes and wonders and gifts of the holie ghoſt. And which the ſame euerlaſting God euen the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, commanded to be taught vnto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, out of the holie Scriptures of Moſes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Pſalmes, and hath opened and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the holie inſpired writings of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes and Apoſtles and left and commended vnto his Church for the ſaluation of his elect vnto the worlds end. By which al gods people ar to be known, by which God will be glorified in his ſaints, and out of which no man hath been, ſhall be or can be ſaued.

The meaſure &amp; order of the viſible ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church from Chriſts time forward, is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Scripture. 3. Therefore the papists do prooue themſelues to be no church, when they ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on this falſe principle, the church cannot erre: 4. How the true religion hath ſhewed it ſelfe by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie witneſſes from the Apoſtles time euen vnto our dayes.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:13587:79"/>THE Synagogue of Rome, claimeth antiquitie, vniuerſality and ſucceſſion viſible from the time of Chriſts Apoſtles, to be vndoubted markes of the church of God, and ſo of the pure religion: addinge thereunto, as it were the ſinewes and ioints, to make them all holde together, the faithfull and conſtant grace of the church viſible, vnder the ghoſpell, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (this falſe principle) that, <hi>It cannot erre.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they are convicted, to haue fallen from the true chriſtian religion, and find themſelues open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewraied, being tried, by the perfect touchſtone of Gods holie written woord, to be lately vpſtart and of a new deuiſed religion, doctrine and faith, brought forth into the world, by the fanatical and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humor of heretical prauitie and humaine follie, and begotten by the cunning inſinuations and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorable ſuggeſtions of him, which vſeth all ſpirituall craftines and profoundnes of wiſedom, to bruſe the heele of the womans ſeede, and to darken the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light of the heauenlie faith of Gods choſen (leaſt happely they ſhould not be found, the very true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt, after the maner of him, that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformeth him ſelfe into an angel of light (they would beare downe the world, with the vaine titles and goodly ſhew, of antiquitie, vniuerſalitie &amp; viſible ſucceſſion, &amp; of the vnerring and vnchangeable perſiſtance of the viſible church in the truth: and leaue out altogether (that which is indeede, the very nature and foundation of the church) the true religion, faith and doctrine of Apoſtles and Prophets of God. But alas, theſe are but the figge leaues of Adam, which cannot couer their ſhame: for as all men knowe, that the ſerpent
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13587:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot proue himſelfe a man, by his auncient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and remaining in the world, vnleſſe hee had thoſe eſſential properties of bodie and ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery man doth naturally conſiſt: So, for ſo much as all theſe things, antiquitie, vniuerſalitie &amp;c. are ſuch as heretikes &amp; Ethnikes, did and could claime, from Caine and Cham or Iaphet; as wel as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from Seth and Shem: and that the true nature of the church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in the fellowship of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doctrine and faith: the ſygnogoge of Rome, vnleſſe it hold the true faith and religion, cannot for theſe things be the true viſible church of God. For no antiquitie, vniuerſalitie or ſucceſſion, can make the whore of Babel to be the true and chaſt ſpouſe of Chriſt. And who knoweth not that Caine was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sheth and that their two poſterities, were the two churches one which is of Caine called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; becauſe their religion came of a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate man: &amp; the other was called the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, becauſe their religion was giuen and taught them of God. Likewiſe in the Apoſtaſie of the time of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, the nations were almoſt ſetled vpon the dregges of their filthie idolatry, when Abraham was now but newly called. Iſmael and Eſaue, which fell out of the church and houſe of Abraham, became goodly ſtates and monarkes before Iacob was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and the people of Iſraell were gathered into a knowen and viſible flooriſhing forme of a church, which was 430. yeeres after the calling of Abraham. Laſtlie the gentils, continued in that apoſtaſie and idolatrie ouerſpreading all the world, from the time of Abraham vntil Chriſt, eighteene hundred yeeres,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13587:80"/>
when the Church was but in a little corner of the world, the land of Canaan, and of that a great ſpace in the territories of Iuda and Hieruſalem onely. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Caine, Iſmael, and Eſaie calling antiquitie and viſible ſucceſſion before Sheth and Iſaack and Iacob, is their religion the true religion? or were they the true church? or ſhall the Gentils iuſtifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, to be the true worſhippers of God, or to haue the true God, becauſe they can brag ouer the Iewes &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with al theſe termes of antiquity, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, ſucceſſion, viſible, &amp;c. therfore he that readeth the ſtories ſhall find, how they ſcoffe at the Iewes &amp; chriſtians, euen as the papiſt do at vs: becauſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue no truth on their ſide, yet they thinke theſe painted paper walles, and leaden wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of long continuance and open appearance and flowriſhing in the world, doth ſufficiently couer and defende their filthie follie. Whereas they fooliſhlie know not and conſider not, or at the leaſt, thorough maliciouſnes and hardnes of hart, wil not know, that an ill thing, the more vniuerſall, the longer, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the ſtronger, the more in cuſtome, vſe authoritie and open familiaritie of men, the more dangerous, infectious, incurable and deadly it is. And this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſme and poperie, are ſo much the more ſtronge in diluſion, for the damnation of ſoules, by howe much they being void of godlines and truth, are and haue been ancient; vniuerſal, viſible, &amp;c. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hah coſt the more ſweat and bloud vnto the faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt, to cure the infected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to bring them againe into the boſom of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and arcke of Noe, the folde and church of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13587:81"/>
Chriſt. We may then boldlie ſay, that ſuch miniſters are to be obeied who (as an<note n="a" place="margin">Ian. lib. 4. cap. 43.</note> auncient father ſaith) together with the ſucceſſion of their Biſhopricks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good will of God the father, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the certaine gift of the truth, which while the church of Rome, that now is, hath not done, becauſe they doo not beleeue in thoſe things which are, they are fallen into thoſe things which are not; &amp; hauing forſaken, the pure and chaſt nature and beutifull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the true ſpouſe of Chriſt, which is the ſincere doctrine of holie ſcripture, they are faine to array themſelues in the counterfait and comon who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh apparel of al the filthy idolaters of the world, the vaine pretence of antiquitie, vniuerſalitie &amp;c. But yet this ſuit of apparel will not ſerue them, no more then that can fit a childe borne yeſterday, which is large and wide for a man of a great and full ſtature. For how doo theſe termes agree to that apoſtalical ſea of Rome which is one of the laſt &amp; loweſt borne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuperſtition begotten of the diuell in this laſt furie of his old age, euen now he knoweth his time is verie ſhort. For as it ſhall appeare in the latter part of this booke, (through Gods gracious aſſiſtance) the ſynagogue of Rome wil want at the leaſt 4500. yeres of that antiquitie, vniuerſality, and viſible ſucceſſion, which I haue here, already ſhewed to appertaine, to the true auncient catholike religion of Gods moſt holie &amp; vndoubted church founded in Adams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſeperated in Abrahams poſterity, publiſhed &amp; offered to all the world by Chriſts moſt bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For an introduction into which matter I will in this Chapter (through my Lord Chriſtes fauour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13587:81"/>
and grace) ſhew vnto thee (good Chriſtian reader) how this religion of ours, now profeſſed and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintayned in Englande (which is manifeſtly proued alreadie in the Chapter going before, to be the ancient true faith, from the beginning of the world, and namely and eſpecially from our father Abraham) now in theſe latter daies hath deſcended and continued by ſucceſſion viſible in the worlde, from the Apoſtles time vnto ours. For although wee bragge not of antiquitie and vniuerſalitie, yet wee doe humblie thanke our louing God, and mercifull father in Ieſus Chriſt, that vnto vs the pure doctrine and true Chriſtian religion is come and is fruitfull, as euer it hath bin in any part of the world, and we are made the children of Abraham through faith in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that you may vnderſtand this the better, you are to know the meaſure hereof by the holy ſcriptures of God, which as a line being gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the worlde doth ſhew the tract and foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes of religion, among the gentilles vnto the ende of the worlde. In the 24. of Mathew, the 17. and 21. of Luke, and in the Reuelation of Saint Iohn, is fore deſcribed, the treading vnder feete of Hieruſalem and the Iewes, vntill the times of the gentils bee fulfilled, and that in theſe times ſhould ariſe falſe prophets and falſe Chriſtes and deceiue many, yea great chaunges and alteration in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be in all the Chriſtian world. The kings and princes of the earth ſhould obey the will of the leaſt, and this obedience ſhould be ſo vniuerſall, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13587:82"/>
no man ſhould be permitted to buy or ſell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his marke in their foreheades: the prophetes and witneſſes of Chriſt ſhould bee ſlaine, and there ſhould bee the patience and triall of the Saintes. Smoke comming out of the bottomleſſe pitte coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the aire, and hideth the Sun Moone and ſtars. What doth this ſhew but that the world ſhould bee found a continuall enemie to the true religion, and that the faith of Chriſt ſhould not alway be vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally profeſſed and maintained, but that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches ſhould fall into errors: and that the true religious and faithfull people of God, ſhould paſſe through the furnace of the fierie triall, and bee as it were heere and there certayne ſcattered ſtones of a building, that is witneſſes ſtanding vp for the truth, teſtifying that there is a pure religion ordained and accepted of God: And not that the Church ſhoulde bee alway a beautifull pauilion and goodly temple wherein the King dwelleth, ſeene and admired, and honoured of all men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Chriſt:<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 24.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe iniquitie ſhall abound, the loue of many ſhall waxe colde.</hi> And this coldneſſe ſhall bee ſo great and ſo vniuerſall, that the true profeſſors of Gods true religion<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> ſhall be hated of all men, and men<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 16.1.2</note> ſhal thinke they do God ſeruice, when they kill any of them.

                  <hi>For the miſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie doth alreadie worke &amp;c.</hi> Wherein hee teacheth plainely foure thinges.

Thirdly, that he ſhould bee reuealed in his time. And fourthly, that this was an hidde and ſecret thing, which did beginne to worke ſecretely, euen in the Apoſtles time. By which wee may perceiue the ſucceſſion and vniuerſalitie of the Church, in the viſible ſhew and flouriſhing of the true religion, is not to bee found nor looked for in all the times of the goſpell after the Apoſtles daies, but that by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it ſhould bee darkened corrupted and hidden. For howe can that bee ſaide to bee the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt, where his aduerſarie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and beareth all the rule aduauncing himſelfe as God? And whereas touching the true faith the people are fallen into an Apoſtaſie? And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he giueth, confirmeth it directly, that it ſhould vndoubtedly fall out and ſo come to paſſe: for hee afterward affirmeth that it commeth of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement of God vpon the reprobate ſaying: <hi>God ſhall ſende them ſtronge deluſion that they ſhould beleeue lies, that all they might bee damned,</hi>

religion and antechriſtian church: and their braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of profeſſion, their antiquitie vniuerſalitie and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſucceſſion, to be the ſitting of the man of ſinne in the temple of God, that is the plague and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoare of the Church, the damnation of many ſoules, and that now within theſe few yeares, the goſpel teaching the true Chriſtian religion, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed their Apoſtaſie: and that ſo openly &amp; clearly, as euerie man may ſee it, if he doe not wilfully blind his owne eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Now if they ſay that the Church cannot erre, and thereupon build their antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, ſucceſſion &amp;c. Namely, that they muſt needes bee the true Church being ſo actiuely and vniuerſally viſible in their continued ſucceſſion: becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Church vnder the goſpell (as they ſay) to bee as the Moone that neuer is ecclipſed, nor couered vnder a cloud, but alwaies appeareth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and beautifull vnto the world: then doe they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently declare, and proue themſelues to bee the falſe ſinagogue of Sathan, and their religion to bee his deluſions and lies. Becauſe the worde of God doth ſo manifeſtly ſay there ſhall bee an Apoſtaſie and falling away in religion and that the enemie of Chriſt ſhould raigne in the place of Gods temple. And leaſt happily wee ſhould bee deceiued in thus iudging: euen in this one point of their religion that they hold that the church cannot erre, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince themſelues to be Antechriſt, many wayes; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that they make the authoritie of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ſcriptures, that they might be iudges of it and not of them. What do they herein more truely
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13587:83"/>
then profeſſe to all the worlde, that there ſitteth amongſt them the aduerſarie, that exalteth himſelfe againſt all that is called God: for what is there in the whole world, by which God is knowen or can bee knowen truely and rightly to bee God, and by which God is exalted, and all his honour, truth and word magnified, and his will wiſedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe glorified and worſhipped, but onely the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red writinges of the bleſſed booke of God? If they hauing no truth on their ſide to maintayne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee the Church of God, they will foiſt in with a braſen face, contrarie to euident ſcripture this vntruth, that the church cannot erre, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vſurpe authoritie ouer this booke of God, and after it to haue no authoritie, but ſuch as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and to haue no other meaning or ſence, but ſuch as they giue: and ſo God and his holy law, muſt looke for no other name, credite and dignitie, but as it pleaſeth them being men to giue. And ſo againe, God and his word ſhould not bee builders and deſcribers of the Church, but the Church builders and deſcribers of God and his word, doth it not then neceſſarily follow, that they are verie Antechriſt and the ſeate of Apoſtaſie. Moreouer, if Chriſt ſay this Apoſtaſie ſhould bee ſo great, that if it were poſſible<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 24.24.</note> the verie elect ſhould bee decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Are not they verie Antechriſt, to make the Church alwaies viſible, and not able to erre?

of Rome would beare vs in hand, that our religion which is that auncient religion of Abraham, had ſuch an ecclipſe, that it cannot bee traced in theſe 1600. yeares after Chriſt: for as before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, it lay hidde in compariſon of the vniuerſalitie of the whole world, in the houſe and poſteritie of Abraham, and ſometime more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appearing and ſhining forth, when God made his glorious truth to caſt the beames of light far and wide, at ſuch times as he made his ſaintes glorious by deliuerance as out of Egipt and Babilon: And in ſubduing the Cananites, in proſpering, Dauid, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Iehoſhaphat, Ezekiah, and Ioſhiah. So in this time of Chriſtianitie among the Gentils, there hath beene as it were an ebbing and flowing, and as I may ſay, a morning and an euening. For the goſpell beginning with ſmall degrees, and like a grayne of muſtard ſeede, was perſecuted by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall world at the firſt. And yet preuailed migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely through all thoſe bitter and intollerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the firſt three hundred yeares, in ſo much as in the firſt Chriſtian Emperours dayes, namely Conſtantine the great, when hee ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt generall Councell of Nice, for the cauſe of Arrius, there came 318. Biſhops, and theſe were from all partes of the worlde, Weſt as farre as Spaine, and North in a manner at the verie North Pole. So that all the worlde ſtoode amaſed, at the glorious ſhining of the ſonne of righteouſneſſe in thoſe happie daies.

Howbeit although that perſecution much afflicted the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and darkned the beautie of the Church, and many heretickes inuaded them very ſore, and diuers liuing in wilderneſſe and ſolitarie places, deuiſed ſtrange formes and ſeruices of God: yet for the ſpace of ſixe hundred yeares and more, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church was not ſo much tainted; but God ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp notable pillars of truth and lightes of his church, by whom the truth of faith and found reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had all that time a moſt excellent witneſſe.

good writers, beſide infinite others liued in that firſt 600. yeres and ſom after by whom the light of Gods truth and the pure religion, was defended againſt diuers and ſundrie ſorts of heretikes, and declared by ſermons and godly interpretations of holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may euidently appeare, euen vnto him that can but read the Engliſh toonge, if hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the writings of our reuerend Biſhops and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this lande. Firſt the challenge was made by maſter Iewel, in a Sermon preached at Paules croſſe, Anno 1560. the Sonday before Eaſter, that for 600. yeeres after Chriſt our religion might be defended by the writings of fathers and counſels: ſecondlie the defence was moſt truelie and fullie performed, by the ſame maſter Iewell againſt Harding, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Horne againſt Fecknam, maſter Pilkington a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the man of Cheſter, maſter Punet againſt Th.

But wee doo frankely confeſſe that ſixe hundred yeeres after Chriſt beeing paſt,

the viſible church not ſo well ſeaſoned, nor the true faith ſo openly vniuerſally &amp; faithfully maintained, but more and more decaied, obſcured and darkned: vntill the reuelation of Antechriſt, which hath been ſince Luther. Neither doo we take it to be any dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the truth, ſeeing that theſe laſt nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeres, were the daies of darknes, and the time of the puniſhment of God, that they which regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to know God, ſhould be giuen ouer to lyes and fables, as is before manifeſtly prooued by the ſcriptures. Notwithſtanding in all this time, it was not ſo obſcure &amp; hidden, but that the ſtories of theſe myſtie daies, doe affoord vs ſufficient matter and markes, whereby we may find, where, how and in what ſort, the true faith and religion ſtroue with the fooliſh and vnthankfull hart of man, offering him in all this declining and apoſtatical generations, the ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light of truth and the right way of peace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but they would not, but they fought againſt it: and herein I will not ſtande to rehearſe all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers (which would aske a great volume) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention that which is moſt generall and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly knowne, vntill this 600. yeeres the churches by eaſt and weſt were in vnitie and the chriſtian faith continued, his vniuerſall and viſible ſucceſſion, but ſhortlie after, by reaſon that Bonifacius the thirde, obtained the ſupremacy ouer all Biſhops &amp; brought it into the ſea of Rome, there grew diſcontentments, which continued vp and downe, vntill Hildebrande came vp about An. 1237. all which time the Greeke church eaſtwarde, held the auncient catholike faith, as we now doo; but by meanes that the Greeks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13587:86"/>
not to the vnmeaſurable pride of the popes, there was made a ſeperation, and ſo the faith was found onely in the Grecians, amongſt whom it alſo remained, as it may appeare by this that in the time of the counſell of Baſill, about An. 1440. Enge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious the fourth in a priuate conuocation at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, laboured the grecians to condeſcende to the latin church to allow of purgatorie, of the popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, of vnleauened bread in the communion and of tranſubſtantiation, ſo that the eaſt churches, which containe not only Grecia, but alſo the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, Syrians, and many other great nations, did in ſome good meaſure hold out the true faith vntill this time. Now in the weſt parts, there were certain men called Waldenſes or Albigences, and Pauperes de Lugduno, who firſt at Lions in France, and after in diuers other places, as Meridoll and Cabriers and in many townes of the countrie of Piemont, in great numbers ſhewed themſelues, from An. 1160. till the time of Luther, Iohn Wickliefe and his fellowes, and with them the good chriſtians called Lollards did ſhew themſelues in England in the time of Edwarde the third about the yere 1371. and thenceforth and in the time of Richard the ſecond whereof followed great perſecution many yeres. Iohn Huſſe and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom of Prage, with the countrie of Bohemia, were famous for the true religion, at the counſell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance about, Anno 1413. and many yeres after; So that when Luther came vp, he found not the goſpell and true religion without witneſſe in diuers places. Therefore (leauing out Berthramus in France, Iohn Scotus in England, and verie many notable men in

diuers countries, whom God ſtirred vp heere and there, euen in theſe euil daies of darknes, ſom by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſome by preaching, ſome by ſuffering and by death, to giue teſtimonie, in theſe weſt parts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes noſe) I may boldlie conclude this Chapter with humble and hartie thankes to God, that the religion, which wee holde and profeſſe in Englande, is the onely true auncient catholike and vniuerſall religion, wherein and whereby God hath been truely ſerued and worſhipped, his elect ſaued and the true faith confeſſed from the beginning of the world and namely from Abraham, euen vnto our daies, which is now 5528. yeeres, and the gates of hell could never preuaile againſt it, no power of men ſubdue it, no hereſies ouerthrow it, no wiſdom or learning confute it, no perſecutions deſtroy it, no pollicie nor crueltie ſubuert it, no tract of time weare it out, no changes or ſubuerſions of kingdoms, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or ſtates ouer whelme it, no lawes, edicts, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, canons, curſſes, decrees or decretals, put it down or baniſhe it. <hi>Magna est veritas &amp; preualet:</hi> Great is the truth and preuaileth, <hi>Bleſſed be the God of truth:</hi> And herein is fulfilled, that which the prophet ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 19.9. &amp; 102.27.28.</note>

How manie waies in this ſort, diſagreement is to bee founde, 2. And that in all the former fifteene articles they diſagree very greatly.</head>
               <p>THere are two things, which doo euidently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, the new and late begetting and birth of Romiſh hereſie. <hi>The Ante-christianitie</hi> or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement it hath, with the pure holie and old faith, which God hath once giuen to the Saints, and the conformitie and agreement it hath with all heretical prauitie. For ſeeing that all men know and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues muſt needs confeſſe, that it is come foorth, within theſe laſt times of the world (for the face thereof neuer ſawe the ſonne before) if it agree not with the wholſome truth of the inſpired ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, and ſo not of the auncient catholike faith of Gods choſen; but reſembleth and beareth the expreſſe and indeleble charecter, of filthie new borne hereſie: it muſt needs leeſe thoſe dainty terms of vnitie, antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, viſible ſucceſſion and of the olde and catholike religion. And ſo the truth is: For as then the Popes of Rome, became moſt loftie and proud and aduanced themſelues aboue all eſtates, when they vſed in their ſtile, the lowlie termes of <hi>ſeruus ſeruorum,</hi> Seruant of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: ſo ſeaſed they then to bee truely and in deed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13587:88"/>
Catholike or vniuerſall, when cutting of themſelues from the true vniuerſall church and religion, they tyed the name and honor of Catholicke church to one place, calling it, contrarie to the holie creed: <hi>The catholike church of Rome.</hi> Therefore as I haue in the former part ſhewed the auncient and vnchangeable religion, what it is and how it hath continued vnto this our age, ſo now I doubt not but that it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, through Gods grace to euerie honeſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any reaſonable capacitie, not foreſtalled with the preiudice of willful blindnes; that the church of Rome and the religion thereof is not of the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, &amp; hath no affinitie with God and his truth; but is altogether, earthly, ſenſual and diueliſh. And firſt of the diſagreement it hath with the true faith: that is, what it is not: &amp; then of the agreement, with hereſie, that is, what it is. In the firſt part the reader is to vnderſtand that diſagreement is in diuers ſortes: ſometime direct and plaine contrarie, as light and darkenes: ſometime contradictorie, where one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the deſtruction of an other, as to ſay: <hi>A man is a reaſonable creature,</hi> and to ſay: <hi>a man is not a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature.</hi> Sometime they diſagree by hauing a differing nature, though not ſo directly ſet on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other, as a ſtone, an egge, and a tree differ from a man, ſometime the diſagreement is hidden, and vnderhand, when there is a ſhewe to maintaine the truth in words, and yet in deeds, comming in by ſome hidden and cloſely carried circumſtance, men ouerthrew the ſame truth.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 3.27.</note> As Ioab ſpake with his mouth peaceable vnto Abner, and with his hand he ſmote him vnder the fift ribbe, that hee died. And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13587:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is yet an other difference which is expreſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in holie ſcripture, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a matter taught in the ſcripture definitiuely, men either take awaie ſomething and make it too ſhort or too little, or elſe adde ſomething and make it too long or too great. Whereſoeuer there is any of theſe diſagreements, they cannot be ſaid to be one and the ſame, and ſo the church of Rome, in all points of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, differing in ſome one of theſe kindes, cannot be ſaid to bee of the true catholicke religion. As in the firſt kinde, the true religion<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1.2.3.</note> ſaith; <hi>It is the ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and doctrine of diuels, to forbid mariage and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from meats.</hi> The ſea of Rome ſay directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: that by the holie ghoſt and ſpirit of truth, they forbid mariage and to abſtaine from meats. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind the true religion ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3.28.</note> 
                  <hi>A man is iustified by faith without workes:</hi> they ſay, <hi>A man is not iuſtified by faith without workes.</hi> In the thirde kind the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note>

                  <hi>the woorde of God is able to ſaue our ſoules.</hi> The ſynagogue of Rome do ſo ſay alſo in words, but in deed they cut the throat of Gods word, by equalling or preferring of traditions, canons, decrees, decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the comon people: and adde vnto Gods word, when they cauſe the ſacrament to be lifted vp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored: and verie many ſuch things they doo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhew that in al parts of religion they diſagree from the truth in one of theſe kinds: it will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to prooue, that their abhominations are nothing ſauouring, of the true auncient religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And this I will do (God willing) in two ſorts: Firſt in this Chapter, by ſhewing how they diſagree with the articles taught out of Gods word in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part; and ſecondly in the next Chapter, howe diſſent, from the doctrin of S. Paul, &amp; S. Peter, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay to haue bin at Rome and to bee planters of that church) &amp; in this firſt I muſt deſire the reader, to looke vpon euerie article as before cap. 2. and he ſhal eaſilie ſee the diſagreement, for I wil but a little open and briefely point out their error, and the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will bee manifeſt of it ſelfe. Marke therefore (good Reader) what I ſay, and be not partiall. And firſt of all they ſeeme to be neereſt the truth in (that which I haue placed for the firſt article) the faith and doctrine of the trinitie, and in words ſpeake verie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly both in Canons, decrees, decretals, and alſo in other writings: So that ſome notable learned men hold them ſound in this matter; and others goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by this and one or two more, they would draw them into the holie communion of Saints. But if in theſe they are (as Ioab onely in words, and that their hands ſtrike through this doctrine, ſo that in the harts of men this doctrine cannot liue; becauſe they are taught and beleeue and doo ſuch things as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſame; then are they not to bee helde and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13587:89"/>
reputed ſound in this article. And firſt touching the the vnitie in the godhead, whoſoeuer giueth that to any other thing, which is natural and eſſentiall vnto god, he maketh that other thing to be god; &amp; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently if the ſea of Rome do ſo to any creature, they make mo gods then one. But that they aſcribe to creatures that which is proper &amp; eſſential to God, may be ſeen in three things.

onely, I deſire him to conſider, whether the Pope doo not herein arrogate the power and maieſtie of God.

               <p>Concerning the fift article, theſe baſtardly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeites of Rome are more like the ſtrange beaſt of Arabia and Ethiopia, then the obſeruers of the true religion. For they greatly wound the doctrine of Chriſtes perſon vnder a colour of honouring him, and they ouerthrow his mediatorſhip by pretence of deuotion.

Which the more they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant and ouerflowing, the greater is their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement with the true religion of God: which teacheth in the old teſtament, thus:<note n="a" place="margin">Eſai. 53.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>God laide vpon Chriſt the iniquitie of vs all, namely, that hee was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our tranſgreſsions and broken for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> And in the new teſtament, thus:<note n="b" place="margin">1.

               <p>In the ſixt Article, the oppoſition is plaine and apparant, for although they whom Chriſt teacheth ſay, that all<note n="e" place="margin">Philip. 3.4.</note> righteouſneſſe taught by workes is but dunge in compariſon of the doctrine of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

And that the authoritie of holy ſcripture dependeth and hangeth vpon the iudgement of the vniuerſall or catholike church, and that there are many vnwritten verities left by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be beleeued and obeyed vnder paine of damnation.</hi> Here is the mouth of blaſphemie, if wee may beleeue the vndoubted word of God, how hee teacheth vs to eſteeme of the holy ſcriptures and of the Church: for in the olde Teſtament hee ſaith:<note n="l" place="margin">Eſai. 8.20.</note>

If theſe diuiliſh blaſphemies were true, alas who could be ſaued? For who was euer found that did or could doe all the foreſaid Canons and traditions?

               <p>In the tenth Article, the contradiction is manifeſt to the whole worlde; for all men ſee that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the worde Catholike to one place, and that the whole Church ſhould be ruled by her ſquare, &amp; the whole vniuerſall worlde made catholike by one citie: wheras one city cannot be the vniuerſal church of the whole world, which containeth the meaneſt and ſmalleſt part of the whole. Beſides this, they doe not hold &amp; profeſſe the onely true &amp; catholike faith, but do moſt earneſtly, fearſely and cruelly perſecute Chriſt &amp; his members, &amp; ſtand only vpon vain titles of antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, viſible ſucceſſion, &amp; other falſe grounds, which are common to all the wicked &amp; pagans, &amp; which notwithſtanding their brags, can not be found in their ſinagogue and profeſſion.

And if they would ſhift vs off with their blind diſtinction of Latine <hi>doulia</hi> &amp; <hi>hyperdoulia,</hi> it is not the daliance of termes that can helpe the matter, except the word of God made ſuch a difference.

of a ſacrament they add a further power, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that the ſacraments containe grace, &amp; giue grace, and</hi>

                  <hi>that of the worke wrought, yea and this alway and vnto all, on the part of God; and that without them, or the vow of them a man doth not receiue of God the grace of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that the intent of the Miniſter is required, at leaſt according to the generall intent of the Church.</hi> In which are two manifeſt cut-throats of the nature of a Sacrament: for by conteyning grace &amp;c, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that grace is in the outward ſigne, and ſo by the only outward miniſterie, as it is wrought by the Miniſter grace is giuen: this maketh it more then a ſigne and a ſeale of the couenant, and giueth that to the outward ſigne &amp; worke wrought of man, which is due to the ſpirit of God. And ſecondly the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Prieſts intention is made an efficient, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; outfacing the inſtitution of God: as though that the being of the Sacrament, depended not onlie and wholly vpon Gods ordaining and inſtitution, but that it muſt haue the intent of the miniſter, to make it a Sacrament. And here they are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Sacraments of the new teſtament: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs heare how God in the new law of the goſpel doth teach the contrarie. For he applyeth the vertue of both Sacraments to the ſpirit ſaying:<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.13</note> 
                  <hi>By one ſpirit are wee all baptized into one body, whether wee be Iewes or Grecians, whether wee be bound or free, and haue beene all made to drinke into one ſpirit:</hi> therefore the power is not in the outward ſigne or worke, but onlie in the ſpirit, becauſe that,<note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 4. &amp;. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the diuerſities of gifts come of the ſame ſpirit, and he diſtributeth them to euerie one ſeuerallie as he will.</hi> And as for the Prieſts intent,

he ſaith in the ſame chapter.<note n="a" place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>There are diuerſities of operations, but God is the ſame which worketh all in all.</hi> If then God worke all, where is the ground of the Prieſts intent, and if the ſpirit diſtribute as hee will, where is the worke wrought, &amp;c? There is yet a third addition, namely that they lay vpon theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the grace of iuſtification, which God ſaith euidently, is imputed to faith without any workes, euen as<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 4.1.2.3 11. &amp;c. Gal. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes.</hi> Secondly, for the number: the preſuming ſea addeth fiue, matrimonie, orders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, penance, &amp; extreame vnction, not one of them hauing the true nature of a ſacrament, for they are no where ordeined and commaunded of God to any ſuch purpoſe, except we would childiſhly ſay as they doe, namely<note n="c" place="margin">Manipul. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. cap. 1. de inſtit. ſacra.</note> that hee ordained confirmation, when he laid his hands vpon children, and ſaid, ſuffer little children to come vnto me, and orders when he ſaid: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp; penance when he ſaid to leapers: <hi>Go ſhew your ſelues to the Prieſt,</hi> and extreame vnction; when hee ſent his Apoſtles to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint and heale the ſicke, &amp; that he made matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſacrament when in the wombe of the virgin M. he would ioyne our nature to the diuine, in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of perſon, &amp;c? So might wee make a multitude of ſacraments, <hi>making of clay to heale the blind, his ſtooping downe to the ground to write, waſhing his Diſciples feet,</hi> and many ſuch like. Thus might we play the fooles with <hi>Guilhermus Durandus</hi> in his <hi>rationale diuinorum,</hi> turning all things into myſteries, &amp; make trifling and prophane ſport, with the ſchoole men, turning vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe the true ſence of holy ſcripture, by alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13587:98"/>
morall and anagogicall interpretations, and when we haue done; come as neere the meaning of God, as the eaſt is to the weſt. But if they be ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ordayned of God for his Church, they ought to bring forth the commaundement of God, ſuch as is for Baptiſme:<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 28.19. 1. Cor. 11.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Baptize in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and for the Lords ſupper. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Secondly, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew out of Gods booke, the ſigne in penance, and the reſt that they pertaine, to the generall couenant of grace and promiſe of Chriſt. As that matrimonie is anie more but a ſimilitude or allegorie, or that confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was any more but the taking of the children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him at one time, to bleſſe them particulerlie, or that orders is any more but for the grace of the eſtate of the miniſtrie: &amp; their vnction was but for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that they might liue, and not for the ſoule at the very point of death: therfore here is great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to father vpon God, their owne beaſtly inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thirdly, in that which is ſpeciall in either of the two ſacraments they commit very great abſurdities, by moſt ridiculous &amp; idolatrous additaments. Firſt, in Baptiſme, they thruſt in a ſtrange<note n="e" place="margin">Looke Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipul. curat. c. 8. de Anex. Bapt.</note> 
                  <hi>Catechiſing &amp; a filthy exorciſing.</hi> In the firſt they put the finger in his eare, to ſignifie that his eare ſhould be apt to heare Gods word, and ſpit in his mouth, that hee may be prompt to ſpeake of faith. 2. He croſſeth him in his breaſt, that in breaſt &amp; mouth he confeſſe the faith of Chriſt, &amp; croſſe him in the forehead, that he be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the faith of Chriſt. 3. He putteth ſalt in his mouth, ſignifying wiſdom. His filthy exorciſme is to coniure the diuell that he depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoule of the party to be baptized, &amp; giue place to the holy ghoſt.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13587:99"/>
And in baptizing they make three other croſſes in declaring whereof, I am loſt to defile this paper, they are ſo fooliſh &amp; ſo greatly derogatorie to Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtitution: for on the one ſide they daſh baptiſme out of countenance, with ſo many goodly ſhewes &amp; vſes: and ſecondly they blaſpheme God to coniure, eſpecially in the place &amp; time of Gods worſhip: but one bable I may not omit, that they<note n="a" place="margin">Ib. cap. 7. Godfather &amp; Godmother may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry together by Poperie.</note> giue baptiſme ſuch a power to make a ſpirituall coſonage, namelie, that it hindreth matrimonie &amp; breaketh a contract. See here if Antechriſt preſume not as God, nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue God: for they make that vnlawfull,<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 13.4. Math. 19.6.</note> which God hath made <hi>honorable among al men, &amp; put aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom God hath coupled together.</hi> But yet there are more abhominations, &amp; heretical preſumptions. For in the ſacrament of the Euchariſt, they amende the ſigne, and put water to the wine: ſecondly, they take away one of the ſignes from all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants ſauing him that maketh the ſacrament: thirdly, they driue away both the ſignes altogether by their fiction of tranſubſtantiation, &amp; ſet in the roome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (if we may beleeue them) the body, ſoule, &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt, that very body which was borne of the virgin Mary, &amp; crucified vnder Pontious Pilate, and ſo being chaunged they giue godly honor vnto it, they lift it vp and carrie it in proceſsion, and hold it forth to be publikely worſhipped of all men, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it vp for a ſacrifice for the quicke &amp; the dead, and keepe it very deuoutly in the pix, to be readie at all times to comfort them that need. Surely it ſhould ſeeme that Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles were but children vnto thoſe, both in wiſdome and in power. For they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13587:99"/>
neuer once dreamed of theſe things, and being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of very great importance, it is meruaile they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had leiſure to commit at the leaſt, ſome of them vnto writing, that it might be found in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but being not found there, they haue their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie traditions of equall reuerence with Gods word, or els the plenarie power of their Apoſtaticall ſea, ſufficientlie to warrant whatſoeuer, to them whom God hath giuen ouer to beleeue lies. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnes of Sathan, good Lord God, and mercifull father, keepe it euer out of this land, that it neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thy people any more. Firſt the mingling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wine is<note n="c" place="margin">Concil. tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeſ. 6. ca. 7.</note> brought in vpon three goodllie reaſons. 1. <hi>Chriſt is thought to haue done ſo:</hi> 2. <hi>water came out of his ſide:</hi> 3. water in the Apocalips ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth people, therefore it ſheweth the miſterie of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithfull people with Chriſt. Loe here a forgerie of a new miſterie, why might they not put in nailes or ſtakes, that might ſignifie the faſtning of Chriſt to his people, becauſe the<note n="d" place="margin">Eccl. 12.11.</note> preacher ſpeaketh of ſuch a miſticall faſtening. If men may add thus vpon coniectures, and ſet Anathema and a curſe (as they doe) vpon all that conſent not; how ſhall wee finde the meaſure of truth? or how ſhall they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the curſe of God, which ſaith:<note place="margin">Reuel. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>curſed is he that addeth to this booke.</hi> But alaſſe poore men how little effect this deuiſe hath brought forth? For by and by, as ſoone as it is a ſacrament, (for before the words of conſecration, as they call them, it is no ſacrament) the wine is cleane gone (they ſay) where is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their new miſterie? How can they repreſent, which haue no being in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> in the world. Againe, how
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13587:100"/>
can it ſignifie this to the people, when they keepe it from them, and bleſſe them with the emptie cup. This is a ſecond preſumption againſt the expreſſe commandement of Chriſt, which ſaith:<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 29.27. Mark. 14.23.</note> 
                  <hi>drinke yee all of this, and they dranke all of it.</hi> Thirdlie in tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, ſee how many monſters they feed. Firſt wee muſt beleeue there is no wine or bread though wee ſee them and taſte them, though they haue the ſame quantities and qualities, and effects they had before, though they corrupt and putrifie as before, and we muſt beleeue that Chriſt, God, and Man, is vnder thoſe formes, quantities and qualities, though wee can ſee, heare, or feele no forme, quantitie, or qualitie of a true or naturall bodie or man. Here is a monſterous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which if you look vpon him is all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer couered with a little rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d peece of ſtarch not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting the greatnes of a mans ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

And accidents are and haue a being, without their true ſubſtance &amp; proper and naturall ſubiect. A bodie which is a thing circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and by the diuine law of Gods creation &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is alway, and can be but in one place at one time; is here made and ſet in diuers places, &amp; yet ſtill one &amp; the ſame, and that at one time: in heauen and earth, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> &amp; euery where. But how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhift here, the making of God to aſſume theſe formes (as they call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) into the vnity of his perſon, that ſo God &amp; man &amp; the formes of bread &amp; wine make not one Chriſt;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13587:100"/>
for by their doctrine theſe formes haue no being, but in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt is vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I quake to write it, yet ſay they, we muſt beleeue this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, for nothing is vnpoſſible to God.

It is impoſſible for God to deny himſelf, ſuch is this tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, it is impoſſible for God to lie: ſuch is this tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Againe, how can this be a ſacrament when the outward ſignes be gone, and a remembrance of him that is preſent? but rather that himſelf is the ſigne of himſelf, &amp; a remembrance of himſelf preſent, neither yet is this ſo: for we cannot ſee him, feele nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how he is preſent, that he might be a ſigne or a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of himſelfe, but a third thing is preſent, the accidents or forms of bread &amp; wine, this is a new learning to teach Chriſt and his Apoſtles to goe to ſchoole, nay this is the monſter of all mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters.

If then they be falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the faith, which theſe two holy Apoſtles taught by the ſpirit of truth, they muſt needs be accounted vpſtarts &amp; of an apoſtatical new borne generation.

that God did onely foreſee, but not determine or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any thing which he commandeth not: and it is certaine he commanded not the Iewes to crucifie Chriſt, therefore in theſe two points they agree not with Paul &amp; Peters doctrine.

Saint Paul taught the firſt childe of the Romanes, that<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 14.2.3.4.</note> in meate and dayes, men ſhould not iudge and condemne one another: theſe men vnder the name of the Church, forbid and commaund, iudge and condemne men, in meates and in dayes, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of damnation. S. Peter taught the Iewes,<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.5.</note> that wee are kept by the power of God, thorough faith vnto ſaluation: theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, that faith without hope &amp; charity cannot performe it. S.<note n="g" place="margin">2. Pet. 3.18. 1. Pet. 3.15.</note> Peter would

haue euery man grow in the knowledge of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to be ſo far inſtructed in the goſpel, that hee might be able to giue a reaſon of his faith. Theſe Antipetrians would haue men to content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with ignorance, &amp; to beleeue as the church beleeueth, &amp; by this colour that ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of deuotion, they kepe the common people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of the ſcriptures. S. Peters doctrine doth ſay<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 3.2.</note> that the heauens muſt containe Chriſt, vntil the time that al things be reſtored: &amp; S. Paul taught the Romanes,<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> that Chriſt is at the right hand of God: yet ſay theſe ſhameles forgers, that Ieſus Chriſt, very God, and very man is really &amp; locally, (by the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Prieſt vttering certaine wordes, which they call co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration) is in the ſacrament (as they cal it) of the Aulter. Saint Peter taught the Iewes, that it was<note n="k" place="margin">Acts. 15.10.</note> a tempting of God, to binde Gods people to keepe the law, becauſe it is a yoke that <hi>neyther we nor our fathers were able to beare.</hi> Theſe preſumptuous backeſliders doe ſay, that it is a condition of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and righteouſneſſe, to doe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and the Church, &amp; that a man is able to fulfill the commaundements of God. Saint Peter<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 10.25.26 Math. 17.24.</note> forbad Cornelius a Captaine of a band, when he fell downe at his feete, and worſhipped him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that hee himſelfe was a man, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and commaunded by our Sauiour Chriſt, hee paide tribute and pollemonie vnto Caeſar. But the Pope the counterfeit ſucceſſour of Peter, refuſeth no kinde of honour euen to the kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his feete, done by Kinges or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: and taketh tolle and tribute out of all lands
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13587:107"/>
whom he can make his vaſſals and vnderlings. Saint<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 3.12.</note> Peter in the good works which he did, renounced in plaine tearmes, his owne power and godlineſſe, and laboured by all meanes to ſet forth the name of Chriſt, that Chriſt onely might be glorified. Theſe filthie changelings haue no end in aduancing the power of Peter, and therein of the name, authoritie, and glorie of the Pope. Saint Peter neither<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 8. &amp; 11. &amp; 15.</note> hauing nor taking vpon him any ſoueraigntie aboue other Apoſtles, or aboue any eſtate, was ſent by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at Ieruſalem, to doe ſome Apoſtolicall worke in his miniſtrie, and S. Iohn equallie with him, and he obeyed his bretheren, ſubmitted himſelfe to giue an account of his doings, for his going to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and gaue place to Iames to determine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, touching circumciſion, and the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be impoſed vpon the Gentils, &amp; had no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter title in the counſell, nor in any place of ſcripture, then Simeon, Peter, or Cephas, ſeruant and Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, or Elder. Alſo hee<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 2.7.8.9.11.</note> acknowledged the ſame authoritie in Paul ouer the Gentils, which he had ouer the Iewes: and therefore hee meekelie ſuffered reproofe, for his weakeneſſe, at the hands of Paul, and<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 5.40.41.</note> with all patience and ioyfulneſſe tooke ſtripes, with the reſt of the Apoſtles for the name of Chriſt. The Pope his pretended ſucceſſor taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him farre otherwiſe, namely the Primacie aboue all Biſhops and Patriarkes, aboue all Princes &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and maketh Cardinals and Archbiſhops his Embaſſadors and Legattes, diſdaineth to giue an account of any thing, and taketh vpon him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all counſels, and to annihilate, whatſoeuer is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13587:107"/>
concluded without his conſent and authoritie, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling himſelfe Biſhop of Biſhops, cheefe Paſtour &amp; head of the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt. He is ſo far from being reprooued, that hee will iudge all men, but himſelf be iudged of no man, and that his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations muſt not be reaſoned nor diſputed vpon: and not onely ouer the Iewes, but alſo ouer all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he vſurpeth authoritie, and is ſo farre from meek bearing of reproof or ſtripes for the name of Chriſt, that he raiſeth vp ſedition, rebellion and cruell wars againſt the lawfull ſuperiour, &amp; putteth downe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings for his owne name ſake, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his owne pride and vſurped iuriſdiction. In all the ſtorie which is in the new teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Paul and Peter, we haue not one word, that Peter ſhould be head of the Apoſtles, much leſſe head of the vniuerſall Church, or ouer Princes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any direct, or indirect collection to be made out of holy ſcripture: that if Chriſt had giuen him ſuch authority, the ſame ſhould haue deſcended and gone to his ſucceſſors. And if to his ſucceſſors, yet it would be doubtfull, whether Babilon, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, or Ioppa, or Ieruſalem, might not be the place of ſucceſſion: for at theſe places, it is expreſlie ſaid, hee was and remained. And as for Rome, there is great reaſon to thinke, that hee was neuer there, or at the leaſt ſome verie little while, and if he were there at all, yet neuer was hee Biſhop of Rome. Firſt, it is cleare that S. Peter kept at Ieruſalem till the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Saint Paul:<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 8. &amp; 9. &amp; 10. &amp; 15.</note> which was ſometime after the Apoſtles had begun the planting of the Church of Ieruſalem, and the Martyrdome of Steuen the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13587:108"/>
Then<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 1.18.</note> three yeeres after Paul viſited Peter at Ieruſalem, and<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 2.1.</note> fourteene yeeres after that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with Peter, Iames and Iohn at Ieruſalem; and then after this<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 12.1.2.3.</note> was Peter caſt into priſon by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, after the martirdom of Iames the brother of Iohn, after<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 24.17.</note> which time Paul met with Peter at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia. Now<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 24.17.</note> many yeeres after it was before that Paul was taken at Ieruſalem and ſent to Rome; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he came, the<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 28.</note> holy ſtorie maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the brethren, that came to meete Paul, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his comming neere vnto Rome: and that Paul being committed to a Souldior to keepe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with the Iewes, and for two yeeres ſpace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in an houſe hyred for himſelfe, and receiued all that came vnto him and preached the kingdome of God: where there is no mention of Peter, who being ſo woorthie a perſon, no doubt it is likely, that in all this ſpace the Euangeliſt would haue ſaid ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of him if he had been at Rome. Now if as the ſtories ſay he and Peter died, the 14. or 12. yeere of Nero which was about the yeere of Chriſt aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 70. there might be as ſome calculate 37. yeeres of Paules preaching, from which diduct ſome 18. yeeres before he went to conferre with Peter, Iames, and Iohn, and adde the time that Iames was ſlaine at Ieruſalem by Herod, and after that the time that Peter was at Antioch; and laſtly thoſe many yeeres before Paul was taken and brought to Rome, and his being there two yeres, all which may eaſily make vp the other yeeres, and way there withall, that as ſome thinke his comming captiue to Rome Acts 28. was the eleuenth yeere of Nero, then ioine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13587:108"/>
that he wrote from thence as ſome thinke, the Epiſtle to the Galathians and to the Epheſians, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no mention of Peters being at Rome. But in the Epiſtles to the<note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> Coloſſians, and<note n="i" place="margin">Cap. 1. &amp; 2. &amp; 4.</note> Philippians, where it appeareth plainely that Paule was at Rome in bondes, and had Ariſtarchus his priſon fellowe, hee maketh mention of Caeſars hoſhold, Tychicus, One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, Marcus, Luke and diuers others, &amp; there is no word of Peter. Again his<note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> ſecond epiſtle to Timothy was written from Rome, when he was now ready to be offered, and the time of his departure (out of this life) at hand and he had finiſhed his courſe: he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that no man aſſiſted him in his anſwering, and there he maketh mention of Linus, Eubulus and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus and diuers others, and telleth that Demas had forſaken him, and Luke only was with him. If a man ought to preferre the credit of the holy writings of God, before other ſtories, we may here plainely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that rather Peter was neuer at Rome, or elſe it was a verie little while: For doubtles if Peter had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him, he had either been his priſon fellow, or elſe ſome way with him as Luke, and not Luke onely, and he would as well haue aſſiſted Paul as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted Simon Magus: therfore it is not without great reaſon to thinke that Peter was neuer at Rome. Moreouer adde hereunto, that he being an Apoſtle ouer the circumciſion that is to the Iewes, and Paul to the Gentils: and then ſtaying ſo longe at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and after at Antioch, and laſt of all as himſelfe teſtifieth beeing at<note n="l" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. &amp; 5.</note> Babilon, hee wrote to the ſtraungers, that is, to the Iewes in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithinia,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13587:109"/>
And in his<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> ſecond Epiſtle, when hee knew his time at hand, to lay downe his tabernacle (that is his life) ſeeing that in all this there is no mention of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, nor ſcarce of the Gentils, ſo that he ſeemed preciſelie to attend vpon his Apoſtleſhip ouer the Circumciſion, there can hardly be any good reaſon to proue he euer was at Rome: but that hee was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome no reaſon at all. For ſeeing his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip was ouer the Circumciſion they offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that will draw him to be Biſhop of Rome, conſidering that one may trace him in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vntill the time almoſt of his death, and no mention made of his being at Rome, nor of his care ouer the Romanes: his abode &amp; his Epiſtles are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Iewes. Further, if we conſider how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting it is for an Apoſtle to be a Biſhop of one citie, who was<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> equallie to go to all places, and to preach in all places (as indeed he trauailed to many places) to<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.10.

It will bee an other euidence of their late ariſing and breeding, if it be made apparant, how they agree with the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which ſprang vp in the Apoſtles times, and in thoſe few ages following, which came neereſt to the Apoſtles, both in yeares and doctrine. And this is in two arguments: Firſt in the matter and forme of doctrine, and ſecondly in the order and courſe of time. For if they haue no better matter or forme of doctrine then heretickes, and riſe vp in the later times as heretickes did: then it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they are not of the true auncient catholicke
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13587:110"/>
religion, but of a new vpſtart, hereticall prauitie and ſuperſtition. And firſt let vs ſee in this Chapter, their agreement in the forme and matter of doctrine. Andiani heretickes about Anno 338. began to bee knowne, and after them Anthropomorphitae, creapt out of Monkiſh rudeneſſe: affirming that God was like vnto the image of a corruptible man, hauing armes, feete, and eares, and other members like to a man. And there is another hereſie oppoſed vnto Sabellius, which ſome call Tritheitae or Triformia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Anno 370. which make the three perſons in the trinitie three Gods, like as wee account and know, Robert, Richard, and Nicholas to be three men. So the Papiſtes not in wordes, but in deedes do the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame: for in their roode, croſſes and glaſſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, they engraue or paint the likeneſſe of God, like the image of a man, and the three perſons like two ſeuerall men, an old and a yong, and like a doue. And when they<note n="a" place="margin">Hore in laud. beat. virg. Mar.</note> giue the virgine Marie power to make men gentle, chaſte, and of a pure life, they haue too much reſemblance vnto the heretickes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Melchiſedechiani, who thought that Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck was the power of God. And what odds in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of matter is there betweene them, and the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians who hold Simon Magus for a God, or as it is in the Actes of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> the great power of God. For they<note n="b" place="margin">Teſt. Rhem. annot. in Luk. cap. 15.10. &amp; Math. 22.10.</note> ſay, that our harts and inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, be open to the Saintes, and that they can heare our prayers and helpe vs, <hi>be they neere or afarre of.</hi> Which to doe doubtles is not of any creature but onely of God. Now when they make ſaints, patrons of people and countries. What doe they els but as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13587:110"/>
the Tetratheitae, make many Gods? As Mahomet the hereticke ordained that it ſhould be death, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man diſputed againſt his peſtilent lawes: So the Popes canons forbid any man to iudge or diſpute of the decrees of their (falſely called) Apoſtolicall ſea. The Pelagians denie predeſtination altogether and the papiſts denie it in regard of the reprobate. The heretickes Baſilidiani tie predeſtination, to workes foreſeene: and ſo do the papiſtes. The Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianiſtes tie mens actions to the gouernment of the ſtarres, and the Maniches make two beginnings, one good and another bad: vnto which two hereſies the papiſts ſeeme to leane, indeed (though not in word) when they ſhut out Gods decree from ordaining, &amp; his prouidence from adminiſtring and ordering any thing which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth not: &amp; that God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what mans free wil would chuſe in ſuch things. For either they make mans wil a firſt cauſe or chance or the ſtars, or that euil beginning. And ſo by their aſſertion there will bee ſome thing of equall power with God, as an other beginning &amp; firſt cauſe of euil things, wherin God medleth not. Touching free wil &amp; original ſin, Pelagius ſaid, that grace is giuen vnto men, that they might the more eaſily fulfill by grace thoſe things which they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to do by their free wil: ſo the papiſtes ſay, that free will is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; ſtirred vp by the grace of God, &amp; worketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his grace. The Pelagians ſay that a man without grace may doe all the commandementes of God: and the Papiſtes ſay that it is<note n="a" place="margin">Teſt. Rhem. in Math. 12. verſ. 11. in margin.</note> in mans owne freewill to bee a good tree or a badde. The Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians ſay, that the grace of God, by which wee are deliuered, is giuen vnto vs, according to our
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13587:111"/>
merites, ſo the Papiſtes ſay: when the ſinner doth that which is in him, hee deſerueth of congruitie to be iuſtified. As touching the recouerie of man out of the damnable eſtate of ſinne, all heretickes had their ſeuerall hereſie, wherein they put their truſt, and deſpiſed all other, and the true way of ſaluation which is by Chriſt. So the church of Rome as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of all hereſies, hath diuers new meanes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie out of damnation, and many religions, as of friers monkes and Heremites. The Turkiſh Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met had his Alcoran, and the papiſtes haue their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, decrees and decretalles of the church vnder paine of damnation. There were certaine hereticks called Meſſaliani &amp; Euchetae, who attributed all the power of the ſaluation of their ſoules vnto praier &amp; ſupplications. So haue you with the papiſtes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine praiers, Auemaries, creedes and pſalmes to be numbred vp, for the ſoules both of quicke and dead. And an other ſort of heretickes called Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleonitae, are ſaid to redeeme their fellowes and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates by oyle, balme, water and prayers. So theſe Romiſtes haue holy water to fright ſpirits, and as their<note n="a" place="margin">Set forth by Pius 5. ordo ad faciend' aqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benedictam.</note> maſſe booke ſaith: they exorciſe (or coniure) the ſalt (which is put into the water) for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beleeuers and that it ſhould be to all who take it health of ſoule &amp; bodie. They haue alſo extreame vnction, where with ointing &amp; praier they promiſe the very like vnto a man, that is at the point of death, which the Euchatae did. The Simonians called Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſt, the Sethians Seth. The Ophilae and Maniches, the ſerpent, Elceſaitae made two Chriſts, and many more are to be found of like hereſie: So
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13587:111"/>
the papiſtes haue many mediators or Chriſtes: The virgine Marie, the Apoſtles, and I cannot tell how many Martirs and Saints, to whom they flie as vnto mediators. There were heretickes called Artotyritae ſo called of their offering: For they offered vp bread and cheeſe. So the papiſtes haue the hoſt of bread, which they cal the forme of bread, which they offer vp for a ſacrifice. The heretickes called Ebionites, Cathari, Donatiſts, Pelagians &amp; diuers others held iuſtification by workes, and not by faith onely, and ſo do the papiſts moſt earneſtly. Heretickes called Hierarchitae ſaid that little children pertaine not to the kingdom of heauen, becauſe there is not in them any merite of the combate or ſtriuing, by which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be ouercome. So the papiſtes hold that concupiſcence is left for the combate to ſtriue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that their actions might bee the more meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and they pronounce damnable ſentence vpon children vnbaptiſed. The heretickes called Iouia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes (as Saint Auſten ſaith in his yonger daies) did hold, that a man could not ſin hauing receiued the lauer of regeneration, (that is to ſay Baptiſme.) So the papiſts ſay, that after Baptiſme, concupiſcence in the regenerate is no ſinne, and that there is nothing in him diſpleaſing God. The donatiſtes affirme of themſelues that they liue a perfect, righteous, and angelicall life. So the papiſtes ſay a regenerate man may do all Gods commandements, and their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men liue a ſeraphicall and angelicall life in their orders. Concerning the worde of God,<note n="a" place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5. cap 13.</note> there were heretickes called Appellitae, which blamed the holy ſcriptures, with verie painfull and earneſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13587:112"/>
So doe the papiſtes call the ſcriptures a thing without life &amp; dumbe,<note place="margin">Iohn Sleid. coment. lib. 23. Literi Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis de ſinodo Trident. colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend.</note> and like a noſe of waxe, that may bee drawne euery way, hauing no certaintie without the iudgement of the church. The hereticks called Pepuſiani, made Chriſt author of their filthy reuelations. So the papiſts make him author of their vnwritten verities. And as the Tacians, Maniches, &amp; Mahomet, equall their deuiſes &amp; traditions vnto the holy ſcriptures, ſo do papiſts. And as papiſts prefer the authority of their Church before the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo theſe allow ſo much and ſo far of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſerueth for their purpoſe &amp; deuiſed wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And as the heretikes called Nazarai, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their dotages by reuelations &amp; falſe miracles: ſo traditions &amp; much ragged ſtuffe in poperie, bee made warrantable by miraculous operations &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritions. The heretikes aforenamed Pepuziani do ſend al men to a city in vpper Phrigia called Pepuza, naming it the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, &amp; the citie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the prophets ſpake, as though there were no other heauen. So the papiſts cal vs to the church of Rome, as though the vniuerſall Church were tyed to one place, out of which there is no ſaluation or way to heauen. As concerning the worſhip of God, Simon Magus the root of heretikes, cauſed his owne image and of his harlot to bee worſhipped of his diſciples. So the papiſtes ſet vp images of their canonized Saints to be adored. Angelici were heretikes which worſhipped Angels. So the papiſts haue a<note n="b" place="margin">Miſſa votina de Angelis.</note> ſpeciall maſſe of the Angels, &amp; pray vnto Angels. Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na companion of theſe heretikes, called Carpocraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, worſhipped the images of Chriſt and Paul, &amp;c.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13587:112"/>
So do the papiſts. Collyridiani worſhipped the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie the Sethians worſhipped Seth. The Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonites worſhippe Abell, and diuers others doe the like according to their ſect. So the papiſtes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſect, praye vnto all their canonized Saints and worſhip them. The heretikes Armenij worſhipped the croſſe of Chriſt, and ſo doe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſacraments, the heretickes called Donatiſtes, meaſure the power and effect of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, by the dignitie, holineſſe, and hand of the miniſter. So the papiſts aſſigne the power of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to the worke wrought of the prieſt, and that the intent of the miniſter is neceſſarie to make it a religious action. And as the papiſts permit weo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to baptize, cloiſtering their holy and religious nunnes. So their progenitors the heretickes Pepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziani, admitted weomen to the eccleſiaſticall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: and the Marcionites taught that weomen might baptiſe. The heretikes called Meſſalians ſay, that the force of baptiſme pertayneth onely to the ſignes: and ſo do the Papiſtes. And as the papiſts in Baptiſme, haue ſalte, ſpittle, croſſing, and other annexed ceremonies with coniuration, by which it is as it were chaunged into a new thing. So did the Simonians and Marcitae olde heretickes their naturall fathers, defile and in a manner blot out bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. In the Lordes Supper the heretikes Aquarij were not content with the two outwarde ſignes of bread and wine, but added alſo water. So do the papiſts mingle water with the wine in the cup. And the Marcitae aforeſaid profeſſed that by words and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13587:113"/>
incantations, they changed the wine in the cup, into the bloud, and bring the grace of God into the ſame cuppe: ſo the papiſts profeſſe that the ſacrament is changed by their words of conſecration and coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the verie bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt, and that grace is contained in the ſacraments. And here they reſemble the Apollinarians which made Chriſtes bodie to bee heauenly and not earthly: for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes ſay, that it is the bodie of Chriſt, though it be not ſeene felt nor heard: and they are like the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioniſtes which accounted Chriſtes bodie fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: ſo theſe will haue men beleeue the ſacrament to bee his body, though it haue no quantities nor qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a bodie. And they are like the Timotheans, which confound the two natures of Chriſt: and the Euticheans, who affirme the humane to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp of the deuine: and to the Neſtorians, who make his manhood equall to his Godhead. For the papiſtes ſay, that the ſame bodie or man is in heauen and in earth, and that in as many places of the world at one and the ſame time, as it is or may bee at once conſecrated &amp; made by their prieſt, which propertie of being in many places at once is not of the nature of man, but of God: therefore herein they are neere in affinitie with theſe heretickes? The hereſie of Vincentius Victor, hath this amongſt others, that the ſacrifice of Chriſtians (that is the ſacrifice of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt) is to be offered for them, which being not baptiſed, are departed out of the bodie: So the papiſtes haue their ſacrifice for the dead. The Maniches refuſe the olde teſtament, and partly mangle and curtoll, and partly caſt away the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13587:113"/>
new: So the papiſt, though in woordes they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge both, yet in truth they refuſe both kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them from Gods people and reading them in a ſtrange toong, that the people cannot vnderſtande, which vnto them, is as good as if they were caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The Heracleonites, make a ſuperſtitious calling vpon God, with ſtrange and vnuſuall words, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to driue away diuels: ſuch is the maſſe of the papiſtes all in a ſtrange toong, and their exorciſmes are of the ſame faſhion. The heretikes called <hi>Tacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Origeniani, Hierarchita, Saturniani,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, make mariage an vnholie and vncleane thing, and of the diuel, and ſhut it out of their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So the papiſts not onely preferre a ſingle life before mariage: but alſo with ſuch like tearmes, make it as an vncleane thing not meete for their prieſtes; and allure both men and weomen to the vowe of chaſtitie, as a purer and holier life, then matrimonie, and therein they are alſo like the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachians who deſpiſed the maried prieſtes. And as the papiſtes haue their Friers, Monckes, and Nunnes of a ſtraunge and differing habite from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men and weomen, and that ſeruants vpon a vowe may leaue their Maſters, and ſome of theſe vowed perſons, profeſſe the renouncing of worldlie ritches, and worldly dooings, to walke a more neere courſe to heauen: ſo theſe heretikes the Euſtachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, had their differing habite from other men, ſeruauntes by this habite deſpiſed their Maſters, and ritche men which did not renounce all which they poſſeſſed, were accounted without hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, alſo theſe heretikes counted the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13587:114"/>
of fleſh vnlawfull euen as the papiſtes doo. And as the papiſtes forbid fleſh and as they call it white meat, ſo their graundfathers the Maniches abſtained from fleſhe egges and milke. And there were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes which put religion in going barefoot and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called of ſome Nudipedants: ſo are the franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and others amongſt the papiſtes of ſuch religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The donatiſtes denie the magiſtrates authoritie in matters of religion, and namely in puniſhing of heretikes: So the papiſtes ſhut out the magiſtrate in cauſes eccleſiaſticall: and as the papiſt giue the pope the primacie aboue the magiſtrates in all cauſes, and at their pleaſure put them downe with their great curſe: ſo theſe their predeceſſours the heretikes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led donatiſtes, doo moſt vilelie raile againſt magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, &amp; beate them downe with menacing words. Theſe donatiſtes had manie vile thinges in them, wherein they fitly father the papiſtes, they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcellions and counterfaited an auſtere life, like the popiſh monkes, heremites and friers, liuing in caues and ſelles. They ran vpon chriſtians whom they met or came by, euen as wee read of rhe papiſt in France in our daies, moſt cruelly murdering Gods beloued Saints. And as the papiſts haue their coniurations of their holy waters and Agnus dei and exorciſmes in Baptiſme: ſo theſe wicked donatiſtes with thoſe abominable heretikes called Baſilidians and Eunomians, had their enchantments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurations: Theſe filthie heretikes the donatiſtes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that horrible hereſie of Arius, did ſo far account themſelues the holie and catholike church, that they would baptiſe againe them which were of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13587:114"/>
the true church, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues only the catholike church: And there were other heretiks called <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici,</hi> that is apoſtolike, which ſo termed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thoght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more apoſtolike then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; namly becauſe they receaued not into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, maried perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; ſuch as poſſeſſed goods proper to them ſelues. So find we among the papiſts theſe vnmaried perſons &amp; religious without proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of goods: &amp; the papiſts call themſelues the holie mother church of Rome, the Catholike and apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church: and are in deed verie like their fathers theſe heretikes, hauing in deed no more but the name of the holie catholike and apoſtolike church: baniſhing from them, and by fire and ſword perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the true religion and doctrine and faithfull members of the holy catholike &amp; apoſtolike church. But what ſhould I endeuour to ſhewe all the popiſh ſtocke, linage and kindred? what neere affinitie they haue with Iudaiſme, in plentie and maner of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, traditions of elders, meritorious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and fained holines? what baſtardlie conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they haue with all pagainiſme, in innumerable idols, and ſorts of religions and in ſundrie patrons of ſaints and Gods of countries and nations? what perfect conſanguinitie they haue with Mahumetiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, making vp (as it were) one entire bodie of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: engendred bread compact and compound of all hereſies, religions, ſuperſtitions and rudiments of this world whatſoeuer: by eaſt and by weſt, rayſing vp wars, ſeditions and all maner of vilaines, to put downe the glorious and bleſſed name and goſpell of Chriſt, by their owne Alcorans, lawes, decrees and

And ſo indeed it fell out, for it was not long after, that Mahomet came forth in the Eaſt and began to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the church of Chriſt, with his abominations.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow am I come to the ariſing of poperie, how it therein agreeth with hereſie. For if it may be plainly and directly ſhewed, how poperie had his beginning (both in regard of the author thereof, and of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it bread and came forth) diuerſe and a diſagreeing and ſeperate from the true religion, whoſe authoritie and time came from God: &amp; that it is of a later gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and off-ſpring: then euerie wiſe chriſtian, will readily ſee and acknowledge, that it is borne in theſe

And this I may ſo much the more boldlie affirme, becauſe that vnto him that marketh it well, it doth alreadie ſufficientlie and plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by that which is written before. And that by foure arguments of great demonſtration, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Firſt becauſe that the true religion is the ſame which is now in England, and this is proued to haue beene from the beginning of the worlde by Gods ordinance ſet foorth in holie Scripture, and becauſe by the learned men of this lande it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taught and defended in the chiefe and maine heads thereof, out of the fathers for 600. yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtes incarnation, and by hiſtorie knowne to haue remained in the greeke church, and in diuers partes of the weſt till our time. Secondly becauſe the religion of Rome is directly contrarie and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto. And thirdly that they follow not the doctrine, taught by Saint Paul and Peter, and laſtlie that they agree with the heretikes of the primatiue Church, and be as it were compact of many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which ſprang vp in the firſt 600. yeeres, which foure thinges being apparant in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this booke, there needeth no more to proue, the new learning of popiſh ſuperſtition, to bee of a

               <p n="2">2. Howbeit I wil here adde a fift argument, which is this, that popery may be ſhewed how it is riſen vp, without Gods authoritie, by men, how, where, and when ſince the pure times of the bleſſed Apoſtles, and founders of Chriſtes church and religion; yea and that in moſt of the particulers.

counterfait writinges, ſuch as are the decretall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Clemens, Anacletus and others of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Church, which not onely diſagreeing in ſtile and matter from the times they pretende, but alſo telling of thoſe thinges and perſons, which were many yeres after, doo very much argue, that when the papiſts, are faine to runne vnder the ſhadowe of ſuch muddie and vnſetled Wales of forged authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their foundation is not ſo deepe, in their owne conſcience, as they would beare the worlde in hand.

If they may thus authoriſe falſe witneſſes to ſpeake for their purpoſe as they liſt, and gagge the toonges of the true witneſſes, they can ſpeake no further, but as they giue them leaue: then may euerie ſimple man ſee in them, that an euill conſcience, findinge themſelues to haue no antiquitie of trueth, doth cauſe them to inuent ſhiftes to colour and cloake their wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries and newe deuiſes: by which they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeeres abuſed Gods people. But GGD bee thanked (who bringeth the hidden and ſecreate thinges of the wicked vnto light) he hath confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their wiſedom, that all this doth not hide their filthie and earthlie generation.

Secondly, if it be of the nature of the ſcripture (as we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) to containe all things neceſſarie to ſaluation, and ſome of theſe, as their dreadfull ſacrifice of the maſſe, rites in baptiſme, confirmation, purgatorie, prayers for the dead &amp;c. are (by popiſh doctrine) neceſſarie to ſaluation, and yet are not to be found in holy ſcriptures, then it followeth that they are contrarie to the law of God, when they ſtand vp to ſhew themſelues auaileable to ſaluation: becauſe they falſely accuſe the ſcripture, not to containe all thinges necſſarie to ſaluation: yea they accuſe the ſcripture of a lie: when it ſaith,<note n="c" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15.16.17.</note> 
                  <hi>They are able to make thee wiſe vnto ſaluation, and that the man of God may bee perfect and abſolute vnto euerie good worke.</hi> But what can bee more contrarie to the law of God then to make his inſpired word written to tell a lie? Here then by their owne rule fall downe their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, forged vpon Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and preſumed by their Church, and if the ſcripture bee true there can and ought to bee no ſuch thing: and therefore of neceſſitie by their owne doctrine, theſe are but deuiſes of men &amp; traditions not good. Now for the ſecond part of this firſt braunch of their rule, where they ſay that the naughtie traditions, <hi>are verie neere occaſions of ſinne.</hi> Theſe traditions breake that rule alſo. For beſide that they are all ſinne, in that God neuer commaunded them, and come vnder that checke:<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 15.2.</note> 
                  <hi>In vaine they worſhip mee, teaching for

doctrines mans precepts:</hi> they can neuer denie by any good reaſon, but that by theſe traditions they giue occaſions of ſinne many waies. As in Baptiſme, men cannot diſcerne the true worke of Baptiſme for the multitude of ceremonies, vnto which are giuen the verie power and operation of Baptiſme, by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſſe, relickes, images and praying to Saintes they are ledde vnto ſinne, being directly againſt that commandement, which ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi> And their vowes of chaſtitie and ſingle life giue occaſion of all filthineſſe, buggery, and murder, and ſodomitrie. But if in theſe traditions there be a direct and particular contradiction to holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then where is their foundation? as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the holy ſcripture ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>There remayneth no more ſacrifice for ſinne:</hi> they ſay the ſacrifice of the maſſe is for the quicke and the dead: the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith it is<note n="c" place="margin">1.

The ſcripture ſaith thou<note n="d" place="margin">Precep. 2.

And there are a great many more, as is before apparant to bee ſeene, whereof I thought good to giue the reader a taſte, that hee might the better remember what hath beene before written. For the ſecond part of the rule, to knowe a naughtie tradition, to be of men, and not of God: they ſay it is naught, if it bee derogatorie to the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13587:121"/>
glorie of Chriſt: I pray you looke vpon all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of theſe traditions, and you ſhall find that they are ſet forth for merite and remiſſion of ſinnes, for ſatiſfaction and iuſtification. All which as is before proued, are the glorie of Chriſt, becauſe there is<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>no other name giuen vnder heauen whereby a man may bee ſaued.</hi> Theſe being newe names challenging that which belongeth to him, cauſe men to giue his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto others. And therefore by this rule, ſeeing they derogate from the glorie of Chriſt, they are no good traditions, but meere inuentions of men, not ſufferable in the Church of God. Laſtly, they are friuolous and burdenous &amp;c. which is the third part of their rule to know traditions to be of man, do but looke vpon the number. If<note n="f" place="margin">Gratians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> one booke can ſhew vs 3090. decrees, whereof moſt of them be of theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: and that there be beſides theſe in decretall and extrauagants, I cannot tell how many thouſand more, then how can they auoid the name of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And as for their profite if wee may iudge by holy ſcriptures, which teacheth that<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe purgeth our ſins.</hi> What profit can there be in any or all of theſe? except we may ſay, that Chriſt hath not purged our ſinnes. But their owne conſcience telleth them, there is no need of them. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they can<note n="h" place="margin">Manipul. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. cap. 8. de annex. bapt.</note> ſay of all the rites of tradition in Baptiſme, that they are not of the eſſence of Baptiſme, becauſe that without them Baptiſme may bee well giuen in caſe of neceſſitie: which hauing as great a warrant as any of the reſt, wee may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude, that they are all but friuolous, and ſuperfluous, ouerſpreading outſlippes of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes.

What ſhall we then determine of this goodly popiſh traſh? but that they cannot be ancient &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentical after Gods word ſeeing they cannot agree to their owne rules, whereby they would proue them to be of God. Therefore that is moſt blaſphemous, that they call the worde of God, as it is in the holy bookes, dead incke in compariſon of their tradition, vnleſſe it be warranted by tradition, and vnderſtood in the ſence of the maſterſhip of their church. Wee are then come thus farre that poperie is a tradition, not written with dead incke in Gods holy bookes; but ſome other kinde of doctrine, which by their owne rules cannot bee found worthy the name of a good tradition: and therefore a meere deuiſe of mans fooliſhneſſe, that is to ſay, verie fables much diſpleaſing and abhominable in the holy eyes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>

Howbeit he would haue vs think, that their originall came from Gregory, but being not certain by any good antiquitie: he maketh Iohn B. of Rocheſter in a worke againſt Luther, to ſpeake for him on this maner.

Now let vs go to another. Platina as zealous for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie as who in his time was moſt, liuing in Rome, &amp; in office vnder Pope Pius the ſecond, about Anno 1460. in the verie earneſt deuotion he hath to pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note n="a" place="margin">In his booke De vitis pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificum.</note> ſheweth vs moſt of the foreſaid inuentions to haue riſen ſince the time of Pelagius the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, who liued about Anno 600. in the time of Mauritius the Emperour, out of whom ſome few thinges I wil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ouer and aboue the former. And firſt this Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina reckoneth vp many things in the maſſe deuiſed by Gregorie the firſt,<note place="margin">In vita Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorij.</note> Pope next after Pelagius. And that he made the large ſupplications called the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the ſtations of Rome, and namely them of Saint Peter, the day of the natiuitie of our Lord, the daies of the kinges the firſt ſunday of the paſſion, &amp; of the aſcenſion, of Pentecoſt, of the natiuitie of the Apoſtle, the day of Saint Andrew, the day of the chaire of Saint Peter, when they ſay the great Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp;c. yea he ſaith he made ſo many workes that one cannot reckon them. And if wee may beleeue him, in this time was found out the gowne of Ieſus Chriſt, which fell by lot vnto one of the ſoldiers, when Chriſt was crucified, in a village called Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat. For wee muſt ſuppoſe that Chriſt woare du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cloathing, which woulde not waſte in 600. yeares, and that the ſoldier kept it as ſome holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and gaue it or ſold it to ſome Chriſtian. But I will not trouble the reader with ſuch bables, onely let him obſerue and marke that here ignoraunce and blind deuotion began to ſpring, and to draw men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the pure truth of the goſpell. This Platina tels vs that Theodatus ordained, that the ſonne of

Benedict 3. ordained that the prieſtes, deacons, and the Pope, ſhould bee preſent at the funerall of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to giue honor to the corps, and to pray for the dead mans ſoule, and commanded all prieſts to ſay maſſe when the Pope died.

Steuen the ſixt brought vp this new cuſtome, that one Pope did vndo and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihillate the doings and decrees of his predeceſſors, wherein the Chriſtian reader by the way may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that wee are to beleeue them when they make the Popes decrees equall with the ſcripture, ſeeing themſelues can ſo eaſily put downe ſuch authentical doings. And here is not to bee omitted how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly Platina<note n="a" place="margin">In the life of Sargius, and of diuers others.</note> complaineth in rehearſing the liues
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13587:129"/>
of many wicked popes about this time, calling them curſed and baſtardes from the vertues of the good Popes. Of Iohn the 16. he ſaith, that hee conuerted the goods of the Church to the vſe of his kindred, brothers, parentes, and carnall friendes, and of that ſprang a cuſtome, which the Popes comming after did obſerue and keepe, that not for the faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of Chriſtianitie, but for the treaſures of the Church, the Popes ſought that honour, namely to enrich themſelues and their friends, brothers, ſiſters, coſens, nephewes, &amp;c. About which time<note n="a" place="margin">Booke 6. Anno 990.</note> Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Virgill in his ſtorie of England obſerueth, that the Monkes degenerated and the prieſtes into tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by meanes of their riches. This Platina can tell you that Sylueſter the ſecond came to his popedom by negromancie, and that Benedick the 8. after his death appeared vpon a blacke horſe, for hiding vp money that was giuen for the poore. And Benedick the 9. ſold his Popedome, and ſo alſo after his death appeared like a monſter &amp; horrible idoll. Sylueſter the third through mony became Pope,<note place="margin">Anno 1000.</note> &amp; alſo Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the 6. for at this time this new learning was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by money and friendes. Damaſus the ſecond occupied that roome by force without the conſent of the people and cleargie: ſo the cuſtome was, that the ambitious obtained the papacie. This Platina commendeth Gregorie the ſeuenth, although for that he telleth of him, hee might rightly bee called Hellbrand, for his preſumption ouer his Lord the Emperor, &amp; for his helliſh and blaſphemous bulles, wherein he maketh Peter his God, ſaying: <hi>O glorious Peter, prince of the Apoſtles, incline thine eare &amp; heare
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13587:129"/>
thy ſeruant, whom thou haſt nouriſhed vp from his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; preſerued &amp; kept from the hands of his enemies, vnto this preſent time &amp;c.</hi> And in his ſtatutes, (a little after) he deſcribeth the man that doth as appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to a Chriſtian, by this: <hi>To feare God &amp; S.

                  <note place="margin">To feare God and S.

And ſuch as Peter would earneſtly haue deteſted, if hee were aliue<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 10. Cap. 14.</note> who rebuked Cornelius in a leſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And that from thencefoorth the cheefeſt labours of Popes, haue beene in wars for Peters patrimony, depoſing kinges and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and tranſlating of kingdomes and dignities. Out of which goodly roote there ſprang vp the bloudie factions of the Guelphes, and Gibellins, Florentines, Venetians, Genenois, Cecilians, &amp;c. The<note n="b" place="margin">Anno 1260.</note> Romanes refuſe to obey Vrban the 4. And theſe garboiles grew ſo ſtrong, that the Popes were faine to bee nonreſidents for ſeuentie &amp; foure yeres, beginning at<note n="c" place="margin">Anno 1310.</note> Clement the fifth, vntill Gregorie the eleuenth.

Popes at once, till the councell of Conſtance. And ſo this time in warres canonizing of Saints, breeding and enlarging of pardons and many other trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries continued vntil the time of Luther. Here I ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip Boniface the 8. with his two ſwordes, and his angels be ſet in the night to perſwade Celeſtinus to ſurrender his pope ſeate, and Iohn 23. a deuiſor of new thinges, he would make and vnmake, Biſhops of Abbots, and Abbots of Biſhops, new canons &amp; dignities in the church, and by and by in another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. And thus haue they handled the religion of Chriſt. Like vnto a potter, turning his wheele, who maketh the clay now of one faſhion and now of an other, that no certainty of truth and ancient godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can be found in that ſea.

From the firſt ariſing of Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrands fire which he brought from hell vntill our time, which haue beene raiſed, procured, maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and continued by that wicked generation, wee may well ſay of them as the prophete Eſay ſpeaketh of the wicked<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 57.20.</note>

This was as Gratian ſaith the firſt generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Therefore when the pope is gotten to an higher preſumption, he is in this reſpect of a new religion. About this time the counſell of Ancyra<note n="d" place="margin">Canon. 14. eating of fleſh.</note> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe miniſters, that did account fleſh vncleane and abominable.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13587:136"/>
then they began about that time, to forget the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, which ſaith:<note n="g" place="margin">Hier. 10.15. Aback. 2. 19.</note>

A thing ſo manifeſtly condemned by the auncient Chriſtians, that this is the greateſt and the ſtrongeſt antiquity which the papiſts haue, for the grounding and firſt full birth of their idolatrie: as thou ſhalt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well perceiue, if thou reade the aforeſaid authors of this matter, and the Antididagma of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende canons of Colen, and B.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13587:139"/>
laboureth and writeth to the Romains and Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, moſt ſtrongly proouing, that onely faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth iuſtifie, &amp; that God had ſo decreed it by his word:<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> and the Apoſtles by a counſell deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the Gentils are free from the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Afterward the diuel prepared diuers heretikes to this battaile who in diuers ſortes aſſayled this faith: ſome fighting againſt the perſon of Chriſt, as Simon Magus and Arius and their followers: ſome ſtroue for their owne perfection and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: as <hi>Ebion, Pelagious, Donatus, Cathari,</hi> and ſuch like.

in the ſeruice of God and keeping his commandements:</hi> which while men perceiued not, howe it beat vpon the foundation, they began to caſt their eies vpon themſelues, and by little and little (becauſe by nature we are prone to thinke too wel of our ſelues, and as men fond of their owne children, we admire our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes) chriſtians fel in loue with this new trade of life, &amp; the pearcing reflex of the glittering beams of their great and rare holines, and new religious deuotion, daſeled the eies of all ſorts of men. Inſomuch as very excellent men and great clearkes, <hi>Baſilius magnus, Hierom, and Auguſtine,</hi> &amp; diuers other, leaned toward this new religion, and began to make rules for the ſame. And ſo the diuel comming as an angel of light, made his firſt entrance and their priuelie ſtale in this iuſtifying by workes vn eſpied. For theſe and other godly fathers in plaine and euident places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being by their conſcience conſtrained, they frankly acknowledge the truth of Chriſt Ieſus and auow it againſt heretikes: yet oftentimes their eies looking backwarde (like the peacocke) vpon their owne goodly rules and obſeruations, doe with the left hand robbe Chriſt of that, which they ſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcribe vnto him with the right. Yet this meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by workes was not ſo bolde and brauely attired in the firſt ſix hundred yeres, to aſſume and take ſuch open authority and hie glory in the church; as it was afterwarde; when peace and wealth made men by wantonnes to ſeeke many deuiſes. Some (as the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming popes) ſet vp decrees and decretals and made themſelues men of renown, ſome by the knowledge of lawes and canons ſtroue for the lawrell crowne
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13587:140"/>
of glory; ſome by ſchoole learning made themſelues admirable, who drawing in Ariſtle and Philoſophie, to make grounds in diuinitie, taught the reaſonable way of righteouſnes by workes and the congruitie and condignitie of freewil: ſome as fryers and cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by rules and orders made new religions and waies of ſaluation; here commeth vp purgatorie, pardons, pilgrimage, praiers for the dead, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand new things of rare holines &amp; meritorious deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By all theſe did the diuel make vnto him ſelfe many mightie legions of reſolute warriers, to face &amp; wearie out Chriſt, that he might leaue the church, that he by his eldeſt ſonne Antechriſt, might raigne and rule alone, and ſo he eaſily thruſt out faith onely for righteouſnes, and the true way of ſaluation. And brought in infinit traditions, vnwritten verities, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, cuſtomes, myſteries, deuotions and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. If you would read <hi>Guillerimus Durandi rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onale diuinorum,</hi> with <hi>Guido manipulus curatorum, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauentura de profectu religioſorum, Hieremias Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> of the conformities of S.

And that the chriſtian reader may the better perceiue theſe things; let him marke but this one thing which is yet

When Luther ſtoode vp for the goſpell, and tooke into his hand the ſpiritual ſword of Gods word, and ſtroke and hewed at one of the laſt growing ſproutes of this new way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, namely pardons and indulgencies, and finding great reſiſtance by the warriers before named, hee began to arme himſelfe with the armor of God, and by little and little both learning and teaching, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of iuſtification by faith onely in Chriſt, by and by all this braue baggage and counterfeit galantnes and earthlie glorie of righteous by mens doeings, like a thicke myſtie cloud couering the aire, did va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away in the conſcience of many thouſands, by the bright ſhining power of the true ſunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes Ieſus Chriſt in and by faith alone.

Againe the counſels for ſixe hundred yeeres after Chriſt, did not decree as they haue done ſince: and the faith of the church was not the determination of the Church, but the ſentence of holie ſcriptures: and many points of faith haue been ſince determined, not by, but without holie Scriptures; what ſhould wee eſteeme, the auncient primatiue Churches to haue erred in faith? or that they knew not, or held not the true faith, becauſe that in verie many articles they lacked the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal determination. Laſtly ſeeing that euerie day they bring foorth new deuiſes and ſanctions, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many times contrarie to the former, who can tell when he is in the truth or out of the truth, or when the Church hath made her true and right determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?

Secondlie, It is of all hereſies and Apoſtaſies the most pernitious. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, It is not tollerable, or to bee wincked at, in any Christian common wealth.

                  <hi>Departe, depart, go out from thence and touch no vncleane thing.</hi> For ſeeing that poperie is ſo directly and manifold, differing from the true ancient and catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo agreeing with all filthie hereſies, and lately ſprung vp out of the vncleane brood of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and diabolicall ſuggeſtion, bearing downe all puritie of faith and true holy worſhip of God, &amp; that hereby the Romiſh Church is certainly found to approue it ſelfe to bee that great Babilon, which is become the habitations of deuils, and the hold of foule ſpirits, and a cage of euerie vncleane and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bird: I can no otherwiſe vnderſtand the duetie of all Chriſtians, but that they bee obedient to that heauenly voice, which els where calleth vs out of that prophane ſinagogue of Rome, ſaying:<note n="b" place="margin">Reuelat. 18.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Go out of her my people, that ye bee not partakers in her ſinnes, that ye receiue not of her plagues.</hi> It behoueth therefore euerie ſoule to conſider wiſely of this thing, becauſe of the daunger that may happen to himſelfe, to his ſeed, and to his countrie. For as it was no pleaſant thing to Noe, to liue among thoſe proud and cruell people of the firſt worlde, whoſe deſtruction hee knew to be moſt certainly approching: and as Lot dwelling at the gate of Sodom, vexed his righteous ſoule in hearing and ſeeing their vnlawfull deeds, &amp; his verie life was hazarded in the deſtruction of the wicked, if God had not beene ſingularly mercifull
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13587:160"/>
vnto him: So all men that feare God, cannot but know, that ſuch wicked and filthie hereſie, as pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is, muſt needes bee as a canker that fretteth euen vnto deſtruction of the ſoule. For it not onely draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs vnto many noyſome and hereticall praui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but alſo to moſt abhominable idolatrie, and the verie ouerthrow of the couenaunt of grace and true faith; by which we ſtand in the fauour of God and haue the hope of eternall life by Ieſus Chriſt. They which ſpeake moſt fauourablie for papiſts, &amp; ſeeme willing to haue them in ſome ſort of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtian Church: doe endeuour the ſame by making their apoſtaſie to bee no greater then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie of the ten tribes of Iſrael, after their falling away from the houſe of Dauid, vnder the hand of Hieroboam. At which time they left the temple at Hieruſalem, and the pure worſhip &amp; word of God, and made them calues in Dan and Bethel, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God as it pleaſed the kinges of Iſrael. But if men would conſider the<note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 2. 2.

Therefore ſeeing the papiſtes are (much more) worſe, it muſt needs bee verie daungerous to haue any fellowſhippe with them. And if the

ſoule bee farre, more precious then the bodie, then is the hazarde the greater. And doubtleſſe no man is able to expreſſe the greatneſſe of the miſchiefe which that wicked broode may bring vpon a man, for ſo much as they tranſgreſſe the worde of God, and follow not the doctrine of Chriſt, and haue choſen their owne waies, and their ſoule delighteth in their owne abhominations: For it is written:<note n="b" place="margin">2.

               <p n="2">2 But if you marke it well this is not all. For of all hereſies &amp; apoſtaſies, which haue happened from the beginning of the world, this poperie is the moſt pernicious. For all other haue contented themſelues to leade the people from God to idolatrie, and by continuance of ſinne haue drawne the fierce wrath of God, vpon countries &amp; nations, and in fine great deſolations and ouerthrowes. But poperie as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall at the leaſt in all theſe euils, with all other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and abhominations whatſoeuer: ſo it hath a certaine excellencie in doing euill, aboue all other infections. Namely, that it ouerturneth the verie courſe of nature. For wee reade in all ſtories of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Chaldeans, Meades, and Perſians, Grecians, &amp; Romanes, that their ſuperſtitions did make them ſtraungers from God indeed, &amp; worthely deſerued they &amp; ſuffered they his heauie iudgements: yet the ciuill magiſtrate was honorable among them, and the beautie of the common weales, was the freedom to puniſh wickedneſſe, as murder and vncleanneſſe: &amp; the people might liue in ſome reaſonable libertie, vnder the pure and honeſt obedience of their Lords kings or Emperours. But the Church of Rome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all authoritie and power from the ciuill
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13587:162"/>
eſtate &amp; tranſlateth it to the eccleſiaſticall, vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie trifle diſchargeth the people of their obedience to the ciuill ſword, and keepeth them in moſt ſtraite ſlauerie to themſelues, openeth the way to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, murders, and vncleanneſſe, and vtterly weakeneth the eſtate of all princes, coningly making them vaſſals and ſlaues to all folly &amp; diſhonour. All this the Chriſtian reader may ſee (before I proceed) if he call to mind the latter part of the laſt Chapter. How be it I will helpe him a little, that he may the more plainly diſcerne what I ſay and the true effect thereof. Three thinges I obſerue in a flouriſhing common wealth: 1. The good vertuous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable liuing of the people. 2. The wealth and peace of the countrie. 3. The honour and ſafetie of the prince and ciuill ſtate. Where theſe three are taken away, there the common wealth muſt needes be turned vpſide downe: and this doth the verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of poperie bring to paſſe, as it were the verie bane of the ciuill ſtate and common wealth. Firſt looke wee vpon their ſingle life of their prieſtes,<note place="margin">Single life the cauſe of many euils.</note> Munkes, Friers, and Nunnes, and ſee what this doth bring to paſſe. Theſe doe naturally diminiſh the number of people, when ſo many men and women are kept from mariage, and theſe being priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged perſons are exempted from ciuil ſeruice: ſo that it weakneth the ſtrength of the realme: as Solomon ſaith:<note n="a" place="margin">Prouerb. 14.28.</note>

poore innocents, ſuch as I am aſhamed to explane as it deſerueth: onely I will ſhew the reader as it were through a lattiſe, ſome part of this euill and chiefly what the papiſtes themſelues ſay: namely that the inconuenience of this ſingle life was ſuch, that when the prieſtes by Gregory the ſeuenth were forbidden mariage,<note place="margin">Antoninus hiſtor. pars. 3. tit. 16. pap. 1. § 21.</note> there neuer was a greater ſciſme in the Church in the time of any hereſie, few men keeping themſelues chaſte, ſome feyning continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for gaine and boaſting, and many encreaſing their incontinencie with periurie and diuers ſortes of adulterie.<note n="c" place="margin">Balaeus de Act.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and ſaid, it was better to marry then to giue cauſe of ſlaughter.

But in the Latine churches remaining ſtill, one example may ſuffice to ſhew what a rich and fatte dunging vnto a ſingle life this ſhrift hath beene and is, to bring forth ſuch vncleane and beaſtly fruit. We<note n="c" place="margin">Diſcouerie of the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Spaine printed at Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1569</note> reade of the Spaniſh inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that on a time it pleaſed the Lords inquiſitors of the holy houſe, to cauſe proclamation to bee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnly pronounced in the prouince of Siuill, that whoſoeuer knew of their certaine knowledge or by report, that any Monks or other religious or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſons had abuſed their holy ſacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to any ſuch abhominable vſe, or that any ghoſtly father had dealt in any ſuch ſort with their ſhrift children; they ſhall ſignifie it to the houſe of inquiſition. But this proued to be ſo great and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull an harueſt to that holy houſe: (for ſo many, ſo ſundrie women of all ſortes, yea of the grauer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,

were touched in conſcience to enforme the holie fathers as obedient children) that they were faine for verie ſhame to leaue it of as they began, and ſecreatly to hang vp theſe holie men which heard confeſſion, by their purſes, whom they durſt not for the multitude call into open queſtion for their adulterous and filthie liuing. But this ſhrieft,<note place="margin">The greateſt policie in the world did the pope compaſſe by the ſetling of auriculer confeſſion.</note> if you marke it is not onely naturally fit to foſter this kinde of filthineſſe, but alſo all treaſons and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and all licence to euerie kinde of wickednes noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the common wealth. For howe thinke you was the Pope able to wreſtle with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings of the worlde, if hee had not all the ghoſtlie fathers at commaundement, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Benedicite might and did lead the people whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they liſt: and who is it, that being ſo eaſilie (as by confeſſion) pardoned of all his ſins, which would not be encouraged to run after the like or greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

To maintain theeues,<note place="margin">Sanctuaries for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of euill doers.</note> murderers, and traitors, they haue ſanctuaries, cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and monaſteries, to hide &amp; keep them from the ciuil power. Their imagery &amp; keeping their ſeruice in an vnknowen tong, with conceiling of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, kept the people in ſuch awe and motherly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that they might eaſily carie the people not onely againſt their liege Lords on earth: but euen againſt the Lord God of heauen. Their holie daies and faſting daies grewe to ſuch numbers, that the meaner people could not tell howe to liue. Their

merites, praiers for the dead, oblations, ſacrifice of the maſſe and ſuch like ſuperſtitions, ſtale away the ritches of the comminaltie, and made manie good heires begge a cruſt at their religious monaſteries. Of all theſe things not onely ſtories and experience,<note place="margin">Polydor verg. hiſt. Angl. li. 7. Lex ad Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortua.</note> but alſo the Lawyers can certifie, by the ſtatutes that haue been made againſt inceſt, buggerie, appeales, holie daies and dead mens deuotions. But the thing that I will ſpecially ſtand vpon is this: that beſide all theſe, which doo naturally in that religion afflickt and keepe vnder, the comely and honorable eſtate of the common wealth, there are other things in the lordlyneſſe and ſpirituall preheminence, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, and eſpecially of the Pope, that make the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſtate as no ſtate, except as a meere ſlaue: and they tread vnder foote all earthlie kingdoms. Firſt I obſerue the popiſh doctrine as it was ſuffered by the Emperour,<note place="margin">Poperie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the eaſt Empire.</note> by his ouergrowing to haue wayed downe the imperiall authoritie, namely by graunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Boniface the third, the title of vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, he loſt his authoritie ouer the pope and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as is before at large declared. And when in the ſecond Councell of Nice, the Empire condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to images, it was preſently ſo weake that it had no more power to holde out in Italie: And laſtlie when the Greekes agreed more generallie vnto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie at the Councell of Baſill: The Turke by and by ouercame Conſtantinople; and ſo the Empire of the Eaſt was vtterly aboliſhed. Secondly though Charles the great roſe vp about that time Emperour in the Weſt, and ſo from thencefoorth, the Pope
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13587:164"/>
hath ſeemed to allow and maintaine an Empire in the weſt: yet all men knowe that the warres rayſed againſt the Emperours by the Popes, for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, in their inueſting of Prelates and ſuch like, hath made it a verie poore thing, for that it was in the daies of the ſaid Charles. For though poperie vſe the ciuill ſworde for her defence, yet it ſuffereth not the glorie and power of the ciuill magiſtrate, to haue any further ſtrength, then as the Pope and his Prelates may well rule: that they may alway haue them at their commaunde. And this is done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, auarice and her daughter extortion,<note place="margin">Popery nurſe of contention.</note> to keepe them alwaies weake and poore: and by falſhood and pride, whereby they are ſpoiled and ſubdued, and their authoritie made captiue, and as it were ſlaine and buried.

Howbeit the king although by oath he ſware earneſtly that he was not priuy nor acquainted with the fact, yet becauſe in his anger he had ſpoken ſome wordes vnaduiſedly, and had brought vp ſuch wicked ſoldiers as would be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon the kinges traitor the Archbiſhop, and ſo ſlew him: therefore the king for remiſſion of his ſins was enioyned by the Pope, to giue ſo much money as would maintaine 200. ſoldiers a yeare, and ſuffer appeales, and let go all his cuſtomes and liberties of his anceſtors, before ſpoken of, and recogniſed by oath of all his ſubiects.

What mixture is there of the feet that are partly Iron and partly earth: ſo is the euerlaſting, moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and vnchangeable faith of Gods elect profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in England, likely to agree with the earthly new borne ſuperſtition of the Romiſh ſinagogue. Set me the beleeuer and the infidell, the true Chriſtian and the hereticke in one fraternitie, how will they agree? Euen as Cain was kind to Abell, &amp; Iſmael honored Iſaack, &amp; Eſau ſought the ſafetie of Iacob, and Saul loued Daued, ſo will the papiſts be kind and faithful vnto vs. And let all men know, that when God hath ſaid, <hi>I will put enmitie betweene the ſeed of the woman, &amp; the ſeed of the ſerpent.</hi> There can bee no peace nor reconciliation betweene vs. It had need bee a verie fine wit, (but certeſſe no wiſe man) who can ſhewe how theſe may agree: one ſaith thou art Antechriſt, and the other anſwereth, thou art an hereticke: this man ſaith, thou art an idolater; the other ſaith to him againe, thou art a ſchiſmaticke: the one abhorreth all images, pardons, purgatories, merites, ſacrifices, monkerie, latine ſeruice &amp;c. The other hath all his hartes delight in them, and careth not what murder he commit, to maintain ſuch trumperie. Can theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or bee reconciled? The perſecutions, priſons, burnings, war, murders, maſſacries, villanies, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, which now haue continued &amp; daily be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by that ſea of Rome, in all ages and countries, do warrant a miſerable peace &amp; reconciliation.

Think we that if they might haue but the leaſt entrance or tolleration, that they would not quickly frame ſome great miſchiefe, which now continually labour with ſuch plots of treacherie to vndermine the ſtate: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that lawes are in ſome meaſure (God be thanked) preſſed vpon them: and the eyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe counſellors watch ouer them and preuent them. Ciuil men and politicians know, that it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to haue a naturall enemie neere thee, and that leagues and agreement amongſt enemies and with the wicked, are but baites, ſnares and nettes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee: ſo much more is it impoſſible that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common wealth can haue any good by tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Antechriſtian obſeruations or doctrine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to make them to be goads in their ſides, &amp; pricks in their eyes, alwaies readie to riſe vp againſt them vnto miſchiefe: as the Cananites were vnto Iſrael. As a Wolfe will play with a lambe, and a Foxe with a Gooſe, and a Lion with a Kidde: ſo may all they which feare God, &amp; beleeue to bee ſaued by onely faith in Chriſt, abhorring idols and louing the right and iuſt authoritie of the magiſtrate, find fauour and peace at the handes of papiſtes, if once they wincke at their religion. For (though I ſay nothing of Gods hand, which is alway heauie againſt his Church, when they are friends with idolaters) wee haue too

many hundred yeares experience, what this new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of poperie hath brought into this world, and how ſolitarie it hath made the tents of Gods Saints. I verily thinke, that no Chriſtian prince, knowing his owne right from God, and the vncertainty of his ſtanding vnder that ſcarlet whore: that (if he haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courage or power in his handes) will giue any countenance to ſuch as hee vndoubtedly knoweth will neuer bee faithfull, but alway vndermine his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, &amp; bring his life in hazard.</p>
